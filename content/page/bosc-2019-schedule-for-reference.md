## Post-BOSC CollaborationFest

BOSC runs a collaborative work event (formerly called CodeFest, and now called [CollaborationFest, or CoFest](/events/bosc/collaborationfest/) for short) before or after the conference. At these events, participants work together to contribute to bioinformatics software, documentation, training materials, and use cases. [This year's CoFest](/events/bosc/collaborationfest/) will take place the two days after BOSC, July 26-27, at [The Swiss Innovation Hub for Personalized Medicine](https://www.dayone.swiss/dayone.html) in Basel, Switzerland. [Registration is informal and free.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KmUvbKo7AXwivjCLkFv3Dd-z4fhNrS2pXotMse9QGCg/edit#gid=0)
