# BOSC 2020

[BCC2020](https://bcc2020.github.io/), the first Bioinformatics Community Conference, brought together the Galaxy Community Conference (GCC) and the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) in a joint ONLINE meeting in July 2020. Participants from 62 countries joined us for sessions scheduled twice a day to accommodate both western and eastern hemispheres. [Keynote speakers](https://bcc2020.github.io/keynotes/) were Abigail Cabunoc Mayes, Lincoln Stein, and Prashanth Suravajhala. Check out the conference schedule [here](/events/bosc/schedule/).

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) has been [held annually since 2000](/events/bosc/about/). [BOSC 2019](/events/bosc-2019/) was part of [ISMB/ECCB](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2019) in Basel.

## Session Topics

BOSC covers all aspects of bioinformatics software and open science,  including (but not limited to) these topics:

- Open Science and Reproducible Research
- Open Biomedical Data
- Citizen/Participatory Science
- Standards and Interoperability
- Data Science
- Workflows
- Open Approaches to Translational Bioinformatics
- Developer Tools and Libraries
- Inclusion, Outreach and Training

# Overview

BOSC is organized by the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)](/wiki/Main_Page), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of open source software development and open science within the biological research community.

Since its inception in 2000, BOSC has provided a forum for developers and users to interact and share research results and ideas in open source bioinformatics. BOSC’s broad spectrum of topics includes practical techniques for solving bioinformatics problems; software development practices; standards and ontologies; approaches that promote open science and sharing of data, results and software; and ways to grow open source communities while promoting diversity within them.

BOSC is usually preceded or followed by what we now call [CollaborationFest (CoFest](/events/bosc/collaborationfest/) for short), a two-day community development session. This is an opportunity for anyone interested in open science, biology and programming to meet, talk and work collaboratively. All are welcome to attend CoFest, whether or not you attend BOSC!

## Registration

[Registration for BCC2020 is now open](https://bcc2020.github.io/blog/registration-open)! Save by registering before July 10. Prices for the online meeting and optional [training sessions](https://bcc2020.sched.com/overview/subject/Training) are very affordable (with discounts for students and postdocs and those from developing countries). The [CoFest](/events/bosc/collaborationfest/) is free, but you must register to participate.

## Sponsoring BOSC

[Sponsorships](/events/bosc/sponsors/) from private companies and organizations help to defray some of our costs. This year, BOSC will be part of [BCC2020](https://bcc2020.github.io/).
