#### BOSC 2020 Talk Schedule

Below are the talks accepted to BOSC 2020 from submitted abstracts. The full schedule of BOSC and Galaxy talks (in both hemispheres) is available on the [sched page](https://bcc2020.sched.com/). You can filter that schedule by Eastern or Western hemisphere (and also choose your time zone).

#### Posters/Demos

 [Posters and demos are now included in the BCC schedule](https://bcc2020.sched.com/overview/subject/Poster-Demo)! There is one poster session per day per hemisphere. Each poster presenter is assigned to one poster session, but you can visit and comment on posters any time during the conference.

#### Birds of a Feather (BoFs)

Birds of a Feather (BoFs) are informal, self-organized meetups focused on specific topics. They are a great way to meet other like-minded community members and have an in-depth discussion on a topic of interest.

The [BCC2020 BoF schedule is here](https://bcc2020.sched.com/overview/subject/BoF). BoFs are held just before and after each day of the main conference. BCC2020 attendees are also welcome to organize informal BoFs as table chats.

### CollaborationFest

BOSC runs a collaborative work event (formerly called CodeFest, and now called [CollaborationFest, or CoFest](/events/bosc/collaborationfest/) for short) before or after the conference. At these events, participants work together to contribute to bioinformatics software, documentation, training materials, and use cases. [This year's CoFest and CoFest Encore](/events/bosc/collaborationfest/) will take place online the four days after BCC2020. [Registration](https://bcc2020.github.io/Registration/) is required, but there is no charge.
