# Submission guidelines

{{< columns>}}

### What to submit

- A 250-word short abstract (text only) is required for ALL submissions (talk and/or poster).
- If you want to be considered for a talk, you also MUST attach a 1-2 page "long abstract" as a PDF. Figures welcome as long as the total length is 2 pages or less.
- In your long abstract, please describe how your work fits into the open source / open science ecosystem. We like to see examples of biological applications of your work, and a summary of the current and/or projected community aspects of your project.

### Requirements

To be accepted, abstracts submitted to BOSC must be:

- **Relevant**: Your abstract must describe how your work relates to some aspect of open source software, open science or open data applied to biology or biomedical science.
- **Available**: Your code / data / materials must be available **at the time of review** at the URL you list.
- **Open Content**: Work discussed in BOSC presentations must be open source / open content, with a recognized license (which must be included in the repository). For abstracts about non-software products (e.g., educational materials), these should also be freely available with an appropriate open license (see below).
- **Updated**: If you presented this work at a previous BOSC in any form, your abstract must describe progress since the last BOSC presentation.

### Additional criteria

In addition to the requirements listed above, we consider the following when selecting abstracts for short or long talks.

- **Community impact**: Please describe how your work fits into the open source bioinformatics / open science ecosystem. A summary of the current and/or projected community aspect of your project is very helpful.
- **Novelty**: Innovative approaches are interesting to hear about, but it’s fine to build on existing technology! If you can compare your approach with existing approaches, that’s a plus.
- **Examples**: We like abstracts with examples of how your approach works (e.g. a figure showing the output of a visualization tool, an example of software input/output, or benchmarks on relevant data).
- **Runnable**: Although we are happy to consider abstracts that describe early-phase projects, our reviewers are likely to look at your code and try to run it. Reviewers like projects that they are able to download and run, and that are well-documented and easy to use.

### How to Submit

- Submissions are via the ISMB EasyChair. If you don't already have an EasyChair account, you will need to create one.
   - After signing in, click "make a new submission"
   - You will see "Please select the track relevant for your submission." Select BOSC (5th line down).
  - Later in the submission process, you will be able to specify one or two other COSIs/tracks that your abstract might also fit into.
- A 250-word short abstract is required for ALL submissions (talk and/or poster). (Confusingly, the submission form refers to this as simply "Abstract".)
- If you want to be considered for a talk, you also MUST submit a 1-2 page "long abstract" as a PDF. (Yes, we did suggest to ISMB that calling both of these things "abstracts" was confusing.)
- If you submit for a talk but your abstract is not chosen for a talk, it will automatically be considered for a poster.
- New ISMB rule this year: a presenting author may present NO MORE THAN ONE talk or poster. If you want your work to be presented as both a talk and a poster, a different presenting author needs to submit for a poster.
- Abstract template for formatting your PDF (optional): [bosc-abstract-template](/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/bosc2022-abstract-template.docx) (MS Word)
- You don't need to register before you submit your abstract, but to present your talk or poster you will need to register for ISMB.

## BOSC Open Content Requirement

The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](/), which coordinates BOSC, is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source Software Development and Open Science within the biological research community.

For this reason, if a submitted abstract concerns a specific software system for use by the research community, then that software must include a recognized Open Source License or Public Domain dedication, and be available for download, including source code. We recommend Open Source Initiative (OSI) Approved Licenses where appropriate.  
Similarly, abstracts with a focus on data, analysis methods, and/or documentation must make these available in a manner consistent with Open Science standards, utilizing appropriate licensing and approaches that promote open sharing, reuse, and redistribution.

See the following websites for further information and examples of recognized Open Source Licenses and Public Domain Dedications:

- [ChooseALicense](https://choosealicense.com/), with options for source code and non-source code licensing
- [Open Source Initiative (OSI) Approved Licenses](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/)
- [Definition of the Open Source Philosophy](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php)
- [Creative Commons licenses that support free “cultural works”](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/freeworks/) : [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0), [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)
- [Public Domain Dedications](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/) and [Public-domain-equivalent licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-domain-equivalent_license): [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0), [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/)

## ISMB rules

**In-person presentation**: "For a variety of reasons, ISCB strongly prefers that scientific research accepted for oral presentation be presented in-person at the conference venue. ISCB will grant remote presentation options for reasons associated with maternity/paternity leave, care for a family member, personal/medical disability, sickness, financial hardship, or potential visa problems."

**Talk OR poster**: The same abstract can't be presented as both a talk and a poster.

### Presentation formats

Talks chosen from submitted abstracts are generally either "long" (around 15-20 minutes + 3 minutes for question) or short/"lightning" (5 minutes, scheduled in groups of three lightning talks followed by 5 minutes for questions for all three). Abstracts submitted in the Late Poster round are not eligible for talks.

### BOSC review process

Abstracts submitted to BOSC are typically reviewed by three reviewers. Our review process and rubric can be found [here](https://github.com/OBF/bosc_materials/blob/master/BOSC_review_process.md).

<div class="well">

### Requesting registration fee assistance

{{< columns >}}

We realize that the cost of ISMB may be prohibitive for some. If you are submitting an abstract to BOSC and would have difficulty covering the cost of registration, you can request registration fee assistance. To make it easy, this request can be made right on the abstract submission form. (Only the conference chairs will see these fee assistance requests -- the abstract reviewers will not.) Last year, thanks to help from our [sponsors](/events/bosc/sponsors/), we were able to grant free registration to 15 participants.
