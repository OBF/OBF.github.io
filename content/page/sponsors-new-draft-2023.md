Sponsorships from companies and organizations help to defray some of our costs and enable us to offer registration fee waivers for some conference participants. In 2022, thanks to our sponsors' generous support, we were able to grant free registration to 19 participants at [BOSC 2022](/events/bosc-2022/), offer honoraria to keynote speakers, and cover other expenses.

Thanks to our 2021 sponsors, we were able to offer free ISMB/ECCB 2021 registration to 20 participants from all over the world!

## What is BOSC?

BOSC is an annual meeting organized by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF), a non-profit, volunteer-run group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development and Open Science within the biological research community.
Whether in-person or online, each BOSC ​includes ​talks,​ ​poster​ ​sessions,​ ​birds-of-a-feather gatherings, and ​lots​ ​of​ ​opportunities​ ​for​ ​networking. It is followed by​ ​collaborative​ ​working​ ​sessions​ ​at the CollaborationFest.​ ​These​ ​events​ ​bring​ ​together​ ​software​ ​engineers,​ ​bioinformaticians,​ ​and​ ​researchers​ ​to collaborate​ ​and​ ​extend​ ​open​ ​source​ ​bioinformatics​ ​tools.

Most years, BOSC has been part of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology meeting (ISMB/ECCB). In 2018, BOSC partnered with the Galaxy Community Conference (GCC) in a very successful joint meeting in Portland, [GCCBOSC 2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/). In July 2020, BOSC again joined forces with GCC to form the [Bioinformatics Community Conference (BCC2020)](https://bcc2020.github.io/). Held online, BCC2020 attracted over 600 participants from 62 countries. [BOSC 2021](/events/bosc-2021/) was part of [ISMB/ECCB 2021](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2021), and took place July 29-30, 2021 (followed by a two-day [CollaborationFest](/events/bosc-2021/collaborationfest/)).

[BOSC 2022](/events/bosc-2022/) was held July 13-14, 2022, as part of [ISMB 2022](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2022) in person in Madison, Wisconsin, USA, and simultaneously online.

[BOSC 2023](/events/bosc-2023/), the 24th annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference, will take place July 24-25 as part of ISMB/ECCB 2023 in Lyon, France and online. Like last year, we will join forces with Bio-Ontologies for part of a day!

BOSC​ ​participants​ ​come​ ​from​ ​a​ ​wide​ ​variety​ ​of​ ​research​ ​environments​ ​and​ ​backgrounds:

- Biological​ ​researchers,​ ​students,​ ​and​ ​post-docs​ ​who​ ​​ ​are​ ​learning​ ​bioinformatics​ ​analysis tools and techniques
- Power​ ​bioinformatics​ ​users
- Bioinformatics​ ​tool​ ​and​ ​workflow​ ​developers  

- Bioinformatics​-focused​ ​principal​ ​investigators​ ​and​ ​researchers
- Sequencing​ ​core​ ​facility​ ​staff
- Industry​ ​scientists​ ​and​ ​bioinformaticians
- Data​ ​producers

# Previous Events

The​ ​OBF​ ​has​ ​organized​ ​BOSC​ ​ [every​ ​year​ ​since​ ​2000](/events/bosc/about/).​ From 2000 to 2017 and again in 2019,​ ​BOSC​ ​was ​run​ ​as​ ​part​ ​of​ ​the​ ​large​ ​ISMB conference. In 2018 (and again in 2020) it partnered with the Galaxy Community Conference.​ ​The​ ​OBF​ ​CodeFest​s (now renamed CollaborationFest, or CoFest) have ​been​ ​held​ ​every​ ​year​ after BOSC ​since​ ​2010.  

# Sponsorship
