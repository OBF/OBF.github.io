# Who we are


![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/attendees_stairs-1024x683.jpg)

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) is a non-profit, volunteer-run group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development and Open Science within the biological research community.

The OBF is governed by a Board of Directors. Our bylaws lay out how the Board is elected, holds public meetings, and conducts its business, as well as the scope and role of our membership. OBF is an associated project with Software In The Public Interest, Inc., a fiscal sponsorship organization, and through SPI we can accept tax-exempt charitable donations.

The OBF is open to anyone who is interested in promoting open source bioinformatics / open science. Please see the [Membership page](/membership/) for more information.

# Main Activities

- Running the yearly [BOSC](events/bosc/) conference.
- Organizing the [CollaborationFest](/events/bosc/collaborationfest/) collaborative work events (which usually follow or precede BOSC).
- Running the [OBF Event Award program](/event-awards/) (launched March 2016), aimed at increasing diverse participation at events promoting open-source bioinformatics or open science.
- Some years, participating in the Google Summer of Code program on behalf of our member projects as an umbrella mentoring organization.
- Managing servers, colocation facilities, bank account, domain names, and other assets for the benefit of our member projects.
- Occasionally issuing public opinion and policy statements about matters related to Open Source and Open Science in bioinformatics.
