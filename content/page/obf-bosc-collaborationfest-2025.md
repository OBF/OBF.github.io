ISMB CollaborationFest 2025 will be a collaborative work event at which participants work together to contribute code, documentation, training materials, and challenging analysis problems and use cases. If you are interested in learning and contributing in an intensely collaborative environment, then CollaborationFest is for you. Bring your own project ideas or come ready to collaborate with others on their projects!

BOSC has organized CollaborationFests (aka CoFests) every year before or after ISMB since 2010 (see, for example, [the 2024 CoFest page](https://open-bio.org/events/bosc-2024/obf-bosc-collaborationfest-2024/).). This year, we are excited to hold **CollaborationFest as part of ISMB/ECCB, opening it to all registered ISMB/ECCB participants**. The organizers are affiliated with four different COSIs: BOSC, Bio-Ontologies and Knowledge Representation (BOKR), Function COSI, and 3DSIG.

### Dates

Wednesday July 23 to Thursday July 24 (the last two days of ISMB/ECCB 2025).

### How to sign up

Due to space constraints, participation in CollaborationFest is limited. To indicate your interest, [register for ISMB/ECCB 2025](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/register) by June 20 and **sign up for CollaborationFest as an “add-on” during the registration proces**s. We will contact you by June 23 to gather additional information to help organize the event. Last-minute walk-ins may be possible if space allows.

Limited remote participation will be possible, but engagement opportunities will depend on the people and projects active on the day. A video feed from the room will be available, but joining will require you to be a registered (virtual or in-person) ISMB/ECCB participant.
