# BOSC 2021

BOSC 2021 is over! Part of [ISMB/ECCB 2021 online](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2021), BOSC took place July 29-30, 2021, with [CoFest](/events/bosc-2021/collaborationfest/) following on July 31 - Aug 1. We thank all the participants and our [sponsors](/events/bosc2021/sponsors/), who enabled us to grant free registration to 20 participants around the world!

Check out the complete [BOSC 2021 talk schedule](/events/bosc-2021/bosc-2021-schedule/), and [videos of all the talks!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLir-OOQiOhXZ6jV_cld3Hp-C_0m4aCznk)

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) has been [held annually since 2000](/events/bosc/about/). In July 2020, [BCC2020](https://bcc2020.github.io/), the first Bioinformatics Community Conference, brought together the Galaxy Community Conference (GCC) and [BOSC 2020](/events/bosc/schedule/) in a joint online meeting that attracted over 600 participants from 62 countries.

[Sponsorships](/events/bosc/sponsors/) from companies and organizations help to defray some of our costs and enable us to offer registration fee waivers for some presenters. If you're interested in sponsoring BOSC, please see our [sponsorships page](/events/bosc/sponsors/)!

### Overview

BOSC is organized by the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)](/wiki/Main_Page), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of open source software development and open science within the biological research community.

Since its inception in 2000, BOSC has provided a forum for developers and users to interact and share research results and ideas in open source bioinformatics. BOSC’s broad spectrum of topics includes practical techniques for solving bioinformatics problems; software development practices; standards and ontologies; approaches that promote open science and sharing of data, results and software; and ways to grow open source communities while promoting diversity within them.

BOSC is usually preceded or followed by what we now call [CollaborationFest (CoFest](/events/bosc/collaborationfest/) for short), a two-day community development session. This is an opportunity for anyone interested in open science, biology and programming to meet, talk and work collaboratively. All are welcome to attend CoFest, whether or not you attend BOSC!
