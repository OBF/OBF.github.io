# BOSC 2023

**BOSC 2023**, the 24th annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference, took place July 24-25 as part of [ISMB/ECCB 2023](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2023) in Lyon, France and online. The [program included presentations by 45 speakers;](/events/bosc-2023/bosc-2023-schedule/) [keynotes](/events/bosc-2023/bosc-2023-keynotes/) by Sara El-Gebali and Joseph M. Yracheta; a joint session with [Bio-Ontologies](https://www.bio-ontologies.org.uk/ismb-annual-meeting/2023-meeting), and a [panel discussion about Open and Ethical Data Sharing](/events/bosc-2023/bosc-2023-panel/).

### Overview

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) has been [held annually since 2000](/events/bosc/about/). [BOSC 2021](/events/bosc-2021/), which was part of ISMB/ECCB 2021 online, took place July 29-30, 2021. The [BOSC 2021 talks and posters are listed here](/events/bosc-2021/bosc-2021-schedule/), and [videos of all the talks are on our YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLir-OOQiOhXZ6jV_cld3Hp-C_0m4aCznk)

BOSC is organized by the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)](/wiki/Main_Page), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of open source software development and open science within the biological research community.

Since its inception in 2000, BOSC has provided a forum for developers and users to interact and share research results and ideas in open source bioinformatics. BOSC’s broad spectrum of topics includes practical techniques for solving bioinformatics problems; software development practices; standards and ontologies; approaches that promote open science and sharing of data, results and software; and ways to grow open source communities while promoting diversity within them.

BOSC is usually preceded or followed by what we now call [CollaborationFest (CoFest](/events/bosc-2023/obf-bosc-collaborationfest-2023/) for short), a two-day community development session. This is an opportunity for anyone interested in open science, biology and programming to meet, talk and work collaboratively. All are welcome to attend CoFest, whether or not you attend BOSC!
