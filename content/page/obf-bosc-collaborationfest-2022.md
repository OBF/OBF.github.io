# CollaborationFest 2022

In conjunction with our annual meeting, [BOSC](/events/bosc-2022/), the OBF runs a collaborative event (formerly called CodeFest, short for coding festival, and now called CollaborationFest, or CoFest for short). At these events, participants work together to contribute contribute code, documentation, training materials, and challenging analysis problems and use cases. If you are interested in learning and contributing in an intensely collaborative environment, then CollaborationFest is for you.

The 2022 BOSC CoFest, which will follow ISMB 2022, will take place July 15-16, and will be hybrid (online + in person at the Madison Public Library). We encourage you to register for the conference, but the CoFest itself is free.

Please add yourself to this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h5woYd0URjgUKInWA2sozDwfThUlQbQQ9xbjdEdQQXk/edit?usp=sharing) to help us gauge interest and coordinate topic groups, and join the #cofest channel in the [BOSC Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/obf-bosc/shared_invite/zt-n5ur1gsj-z2C~69_4lYTFPg5tbWA8Ew)!
