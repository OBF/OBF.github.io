### Sara El-Gebali (SciLifeLab-DataCentre-Sweden)

###### _A New Odyssey: Pioneering the Future of Scientific Progress Through Open Collaboration_

_Join us in humanity's quest for knowledge and understanding, on a transformative odyssey of scientific progress, fueled by the power of open collaboration. This presentation will navigate the realms of scientific discovery, exploring the profound impact of globally inclusive and collaborative efforts that have the potential to revolutionize the very fabric of scientific advancement.  
_

_As we embark on this journey, we will delve into the principles of diverse global alliances and pioneering scientific institutions, illustrating how their values align with real-world initiatives that promote open science, and provide examples of the groundbreaking opportunities that arise when individuals from various backgrounds, disciplines, and experiences unite in pursuit of a common goal._

_In the spirit of "Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations," this presentation will showcase inspiring examples of collaboration and inclusivity in action, demonstrating how community building, mentorship programs, and grassroots movements play an essential role in fostering inclusive scientific communities._

_These initiatives empower individuals from underrepresented backgrounds to overcome barriers, access valuable resources, and contribute their unique perspectives to the scientific conversation. By nurturing a culture of inclusivity and support, we can create a flourishing environment that encourages the exchange of ideas and accelerates the pace of scientific discovery. Join us as we chart a course toward a brighter, more inclusive future, where the collective power of diverse minds and open collaboration propels us forward into the uncharted territories of scientific discovery._

Sara El-Gebali is a Project Leader at SciLifeLab-Data Centre in Sweden, where she leads the implementation of technical solutions that facilitate data-driven research on a national scale. She is the founder of [FAIRPoints](https://www.fairpoints.org/), a community driven initiative highlighting pragmatic measures towards the implementing the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles. As a member of the steering committee for the FAIR Digital Objects forum, she advocates for inclusive and meaningful engagement practices, as well as the promotion of equitable technical solutions development.

With a strong background in life science and a PhD in cancer research, Sara is a passionate community builder and an outspoken advocate for the inclusion of historically marginalized groups in STEM and Open Science. She is the founder of OpenCIDER (Open Computational Inclusion & Digital Equity Resource), a knowledge space that highlights communities and resources related to Open Data from a global perspective to ensure equitable and effective engagement from underrepresented groups.

### Joseph M. Yracheta (Native BioData Consortium)

###### _The Dissonance between Scientific Altruism & Capitalist Extraction: The Zero Trust and Federated Data Sovereignty Solution_

_The history that led to the roadbuilding of Open Data’s current pathway is a murky one and one that isn’t fully transparent as to causes, sponsors or decision makers. The philosophical underpinnings and moral obligation of Open Data is flawed and over prioritizes funding commitments and scientists’ rights to data rather than the privacy, development and implementation obligations that are often left to the unjust realm of commercial capitalization. Mr. Yracheta will discuss from the USA’s American Indian perspective (as sovereign Domestic Dependent Nations) and their relationship with states’ and federal governments. Several U.S. policy documents and legislative acts that were created in and out of consultation with American Indian nations will be shared and discussed. Key gaps in the moral obligation to society at large will be demonstrated via this special relationship with tribes. Where possible, Mr. Yracheta will employ game theory to move the Open Data argument into a more socially just and philosophically robust posture. Interrogated are two possible pathways to our current landscape 1) Is the current Open Data environment well intended but ignorant? Neglectful? Aligned with or against the Belmont Principle of Non-Coercion? Or 2) Is the current Open Data environment obfuscatory, purposely predatory and extractive? The answers to either position will determine the timing and delivery of benefits to societies and individuals.

Joseph M. Yracheta is an Amerindigenous Scientist (P’urhepecha y Raramuri from Mexico) and Executive Director of the Native BioData Consortium within the Cheyenne River Lakota Nation (Sioux). Mr. Yracheta has been a scientist since 1990; he started as a bench biotechnician and worked across many disciplines. In 2014 he graduated from UW Seattle with a master’s in Pharmaceutics and Bioethics under Drs. Ken Thummel and Wylie Burke. He is currently finishing a DrPH in Environmental Health and Engineering from Johns Hopkins under Drs. Ana Navas-Acien and Paul Locke.

Mr. Yracheta is passionately working to end Amerindigenous Health Disparity by the "wearing many research hats" of law, ethics, policy, genomics, omics, health outcomes, epidemiology, health care prevention/intervention and allostatic load from systemic racism. Mr. Yracheta believes that ALL data and resources must be seen as unforeseen futures, where their value will constantly change. He feels this data must be secured for Indigenous economic sustainability.
