## Birds of a Feather (BoFs)

Birds of a Feather (BoFs) are informal, self-organized meetups focused on specific topics. They are a great way to meet other like-minded community members and have an in-depth discussion on a topic of interest.

The [BCC2020 BoF schedule is here](https://bcc2020.sched.com/overview/subject/BoF). BoFs are held just before and after each day of the main conference. BCC2020 attendees are also welcome to organize informal BoFs as table chats.
