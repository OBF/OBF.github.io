# Data Sustainability

In the rapidly evolving landscape of bioinformatics, research data is the bedrock of discovery, innovation, and progress. But how secure is this foundation for the future?
This panel will examine the critical challenge of Data Sustainability: the proactive and principled approach to ensuring that valuable research data, along with the necessary infrastructure, funding, expertise, and governance, remains findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR), and ethically managed throughout its entire life cycle and for future generations.
It is about transforming data from a transient output into a durable asset that continues to yield scientific insights and maximize return on investment over decades.

The imperative to responsibly manage and preserve our collective digital knowledge has never been more acute.
Enabling data to be efficiently preserved, shared, and reused accelerates discovery, decreases redundancy, and safeguards the substantial investments made in research.
In a challenging funding landscape where critical biomedical datasets can be at risk of being deprioritized, censored, or lost, the need to champion sustainable data practices is paramount.
Lost or inaccessible data represents a setback to scientific advancement, leading to wasted resources and the costly repetition of already completed research and analyses.

This panel will bring together a variety of perspectives to explore the various challenges and possible solutions for achieving data sustainability.
We will discuss practical strategies and address pressing questions on the topics of FAIR and CARE principles in action (and their limitations for sustainability), sustainable funding and infrastructure models, the role of open source and open science in long-term sustainability, data lifecycle management and stewardship, technical and scalability challenges, and ethical considerations.

# Panelists

### Susanna-Assunta Sansone

{{<columns >}}

At the University of Oxford, Professor Susanna-Assunta Sansone holds three roles: Academic Lead for Research Practice, Professor of Data Readiness in the Department of Engineering Science, and Director of the Oxford e-Research Centre, where she leads the Data Readiness Group to develop open-source software, community standards, and educational resources, enhancing collection, representation, sharing, publication, and reuse of multi-dimensional data.
She has worked since 2001 in the areas of data interoperability and reproducibility, research integrity, and the evolution of scholarly publishing. her team of data engineers researches and develops new methods and tools to make digital research objects (including data, software, model and workflows) FAIR.

### Chris Mungall

{{< columns >}}

Dr. Chris Mungall, a Senior Scientist at Berkeley Lab, has led the creation of key biological ontologies for the integration of resources covering gene function, anatomy, phenotypes and the environment, including the Gene Ontology, the Uberon anatomy ontology, the Cell Ontology (CL), and the Mondo disease ontology.
His research centers around the capture, computational integration, and dissemination of biological research data, and the development of methods for using this data to elucidate biological mechanisms underpinning the health of humans and of the planet.
For decades, he has been a strong advocate for open-source bioinformatics software, open standards, and open science.
