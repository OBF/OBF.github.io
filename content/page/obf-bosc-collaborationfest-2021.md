# CollaborationFest 2021

In conjunction with our annual meeting, [BOSC](/events/bosc-2021/), the OBF runs a collaborative event (formerly called CodeFest, short for coding festival, and now called CollaborationFest, or CoFest for short). At these events, participants work together to contribute contribute code, documentation, training materials, and challenging analysis problems and use cases. If you are interested in learning and contributing in an intensely collaborative environment, then CollaborationFest is for you.

The 2021 BOSC CoFest, which will follow ISMB/ECCB 2021, will take place July 31 - August 1 online. We encourage you to register for the conference, but the CoFest itself is free.

Please add yourself to this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12liEMy5QL1UAG-PrqQgjEaizVqAUMgfS1-uS9Vr97bw/edit#gid=0) to help gauge interest and coordinate topic groups. Please stay tuned as more details are worked out!
