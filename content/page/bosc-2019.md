# BOSC 2019

BOSC 2019 was a success! We look forward to [BOSC 2020](/events/bosc/) (with GCC2020 as part of the [Bioinformatics Community Conference](https://bcc2020.github.io/)) in Toronto, Canada, July 18-21, 2020.

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) has been [held annually since 2000](/events/bosc/about/). In 2019, BOSC was part of [ISMB/ECCB](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2019) in Basel. See the full [schedule of talks, posters](/events/bosc-2019-schedule/) and [Birds of a Feather](/events/bosc/2019-bofs/) meetups.

# Overview

BOSC is organized by the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)](/wiki/Main_Page), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of open source software development and open science within the biological research community.

Since its inception in 2000, BOSC has provided a forum for developers and users to interact and share research results and ideas in open source bioinformatics. BOSC’s broad spectrum of topics includes practical techniques for solving bioinformatics problems; software development practices; standards and ontologies; approaches that promote open science and sharing of data, results and software; and ways to grow open source communities while promoting diversity within them.

BOSC is usually preceded or followed by what we now call [CollaborationFest (CoFest](/events/bosc/collaborationfest/) for short), a two-day community development session. This is an opportunity for anyone interested in open science, biology and programming to meet, talk and work collaboratively. All are welcome to attend CoFest 2019 (whether or not you attend BOSC)!

- Open Biomedical Data
- Citizen/Participatory Science
- Standards and Interoperability
- Data Science
- Workflows
- Open Approaches to Translational Bioinformatics
- Developer Tools and Libraries

## Registration

BOSC 2019 will take place the last two full days of [ISMB/ECCB 2019](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2019). You can [register](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2019-registration) for the full ISMB/ECCB meeting (July 21-25) or just for the two days of BOSC (July 24-25).

When you register for ISMB, you will select a primary COSI (such as BOSC) but you will be able to move freely between all of the [COSIs](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2019/2209) that take place as parallel tracks during the days for which you register.
