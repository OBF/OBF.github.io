# CollaborationFest 2024

In conjunction with our annual meeting, [BOSC](/events/bosc-2024/), the OBF runs a collaborative event (formerly called CodeFest, short for coding festival, and now called CollaborationFest, or CoFest for short). At these events, participants work together to contribute code, documentation, training materials, and challenging analysis problems and use cases. If you are interested in learning and contributing in an intensely collaborative environment, then CollaborationFest is for you.

The 2024 BOSC CoFest, which will **follow** ISMB 2024, will take place July 17-18, and will be hybrid (in person in Montréal + online). We encourage you to register for the conference, but the CoFest itself is free.
