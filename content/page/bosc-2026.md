<div class="well">

**BOSC 2026**, the 27th annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference, will take place July 13-14 or July 15-16 in Washington, DC, as part of [ISMB 2026](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2026/home). We hope you will join us in person or online!

</div>

Since 2000, BOSC has covered all aspects of open source bioinformatics and open science. [BOSC 2025](/events/bosc-2025/) took place July 21-22, 2025 in Liverpool, UK (as part of
  [ISMB/ECCB 2025](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/home)). Read our [BOSC 2025 report on F1000Research](https://f1000research.com/articles/14-887/v1)! 
BOSC 2025 included two days of [keynote talks](/events/bosc-2025/bosc-2025-keynotes/), talks from submitted abstracts, a [panel discussion on data sustainability](/events/bosc-2025/panel), and posters. It also featured a [joint session](/2025/03/17/BOSC-BOKR-2025) with the
[Bio-Ontologies and Knowledge Representation (BOKR)](https://www.bio-ontologies.org.uk/2025-meeting), which opened with a [joint keynote by Chris Mungall](/events/bosc-2025/bosc-2025-keynotes/) followed by talks on some of our favorite topics, including open data and reusable and reproducible science. The full lineup of BOSC 2025 talks and posters, including links to talk videos, is available on our [Schedule page](/events/bosc-2025/bosc-2025-schedule/).

### About BOSC


The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) has been [held annually since 2000](/events/bosc/about/). BOSC is organized by the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)](/wiki/Main_Page), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of open source software development and open science within the biological research community.

Since its inception, BOSC has provided a forum for developers and users to interact and share research results and ideas in open source bioinformatics. BOSC’s broad spectrum of topics includes practical techniques for solving bioinformatics problems; software development practices; standards and ontologies; approaches that promote open science and sharing of data, results and software; and ways to grow and sustain open source communities.

![BOSC 2025 organizing committee](/img/2025/bosc2025-img/Carlo%20Moni%20Deepak%20Nomi%20-%20CoFest%20table.jpeg)

BOSC is usually preceded or followed by [CollaborationFest](/events/bosc/collaborationfest/)
(CoFest for short), a two-day collaborative work session. This is an opportunity for anyone interested in open science, biology or programming to meet, talk and work collaboratively.
In 2025, CollaborationFest was part of ISMB/ECCB.
