## Birds of a Feather (BoFs)

Birds of a Feather (BoFs) are informal, self-organized meetups focused on specific topics. They are a great way to meet other like-minded community members and have an in-depth discussion on a topic of shared interest.

BoFs at ISMB/ECCB 2021 will take place each day of the meeting except the last day, at the same time as the poster session (not ideal, we knowâ€“but there are only so many viable hours in the day), from 15:20-16:20 UTC. The BoFs that are relevant to BOSC attendees will be scheduled on Thursday, July 29 (the first day of BOSC) or Wednesday, July 28 (the day before BOSC). They will be listed here after the BoF proposal deadline (June 25)

ISMB/ECCB 2021 attendees are also welcome to organize informal BoFs as table chats in the Cafe Connect.
