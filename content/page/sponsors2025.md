### Sponsoring BOSC 2025

{{< columns >}}

Sponsorships from companies and non-profit organizations help to defray some of our costs and enable us to offer free registration for some conference participants. In 2024, thanks to our sponsors’ generous support, we were able to grant free registration to 15 participants, offer honoraria to keynote speakers, and cover other expenses.

## What is BOSC?

BOSC is an annual meeting organized by the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)](/), a non-profit, volunteer-run group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development and Open Science within the biological research community.

Each BOSC ​includes ​talks,​ ​poster​ ​sessions,​ ​panel, and ​lots​ ​of​ ​opportunities​ ​for​ ​networking. It is followed by​ ​collaborative​ ​working​ ​sessions​ ​at the [CollaborationFest](/events/bosc/collaborationfest/).​ ​These​ ​events​ ​bring​ ​together​ ​software​ ​engineers,​ ​bioinformaticians,​ ​and​ ​researchers​ ​to collaborate​ ​and​ ​extend​ ​open​ ​source​ ​bioinformatics​ ​tools.

![Panel at BOSC 2015](/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/BOSC2015-panel-1-1024x521.jpg)

BOSC​ ​participants​ ​come​ ​from​ ​a​ ​wide​ ​variety​ ​of​ ​research​ ​environments​ ​and​ ​backgrounds:

- Biological​ ​researchers,​ ​students,​ ​and​ ​post-docs​ ​who are​ ​learning​ ​bioinformatics​ ​analysis tools and techniques
- Power​ ​bioinformatics​ ​users
- Bioinformatics​ ​tool​ ​and​ ​workflow​ ​developers
- Bioinformatics​-focused​ ​principal​ ​investigators​ ​and​ ​researchers
- Sequencing​ ​core​ ​facility​ ​staff
- Industry​ ​scientists​ ​and​ ​bioinformaticians
- Data​ ​producers

## Previous Events

BOSC​ has been held [every​ ​year​ ​since​ ​2000](/events/bosc/about/).​ Most years, BOSC has been part of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology meeting (ISMB).

In 2018, BOSC partnered with the Galaxy Community Conference (GCC) in a very successful joint meeting in Portland, [GCCBOSC 2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/). In July 2020, BOSC again joined forces with GCC to form the [Bioinformatics Community Conference (BCC2020)](https://bcc2020.github.io/). Held online, BCC2020 attracted over 600 participants from 62 countries.

[BOSC 2021](/events/bosc-2021/) was part of [ISMB/ECCB 2021](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2021), and took place July 29-30, 2021 (followed by a two-day [CollaborationFest](/events/bosc-2021/collaborationfest/)).

[BOSC 2022](/events/bosc-2022/) was held July 13-14, 2022, as part of [ISMB 2022](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2022) in person in Madison, Wisconsin, USA, and simultaneously online.

[BOSC 2023](/events/bosc-2023/) took place July 24-25, 2023 as part of [ISMB/ECCB 2023](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2023) in Lyon, France and online. Like the previous year, we joined forces with Bio-Ontologies for part of a day!

[BOSC 2024](/events/bosc-2024/), the 25th annual Bioinformatics Open
Source Conference, took place July 15-16, 2024 as part of
[ISMB 2024](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2024/home) in Montreal, Canada
and online. It was followed by [CoFest 2024](/events/bosc-2024/ismb-collaborationfest-2024/).

[BOSC 2025](/events/bosc-2025/) will be held in Liverpool, UK, as part
of the large [ISMB/ECCB 2025](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/home)
conference. This year, for the first time,
[CollaborationFest](/events/bosc-2025/ismb-collaborationfest-2025/)
will be part of the main ISMB/ECCB conference and will be open to all.

## Benefits of Sponsorship

Sponsoring BOSC increases your visibility in the bioinformatics community. 
We acknowledge our sponsors before, during and after the event in multiple ways:

- We list our sponsors on the BOSC website
- Sponsors are thanked and named in the introduction/closing slides during the meeting
- We show the sponsor logos on large BOSC posters displayed outside the meeting room and in the poster area
- The sponsors are thanked in selected emails to our mailing list and social media posts (with your logo) that go out before, during and after the event
- The sponsors are listed in our published reports after the meeting, e.g., [https://f1000research.com/articles/7-1309/v1](https://f1000research.com/articles/7-1309/v1)
- Platinum sponsors can show a short video before the first keynote
- Gold sponsors can show a short video some time during the conference
- We are open to discussing specific requests, such as distributing stickers or leaflets, or earmarking the sponsorship for a specific activity.
