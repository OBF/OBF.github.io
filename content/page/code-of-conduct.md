The [OBF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/tree/master/code-of-conduct) was adopted after being [voted on by our members in January 2022](/2022/01/27/approved-by-obf-membership-vote/), following the OBF Public Board meeting in September 2021.

Our annual conference, [BOSC](/events/bosc/), is normally run as part of the ISMB meeting, where it therefore follows the [OBF Code of Conduct](https://www.iscb.org/iscb-policy-statements/iscb-code-of-conduct).
