# Support the OBF

### Sponsorship opportunities

Our annual meetings, [BOSC](/events/bosc/) and the [CollaborationFest](/events/bosc/collaborationfest/), are supported in part by sponsorships. Please see the [Sponsors](/events/bosc/sponsors/) page for more information.

### Tax-free donations

Through our fiscal sponsor,Â [Software in the Public Interest, Inc.](http://spi-inc.org/donations), you can donate to the OBF via [PayPal](http://spi-inc.org/projects/obf/) or [online by credit card](https://co.clickandpledge.com/advanced/default.aspx?wid=66788#). Donations made through SPI are 501(c)3 tax-exempt in the US.
