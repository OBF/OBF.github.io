Sponsorships from companies and organizations help to defray some of our costs and enable us to offer registration fee waivers for some conference participants. In 2023, thanks to our [sponsors'](/events/sponsors-2023/) generous support, we were able to grant free registration to 15 participants (13 from underrepresented groups) at [BOSC 2023](/events/bosc-2023/), offer honoraria to keynote speakers, and cover other expenses.

If you’re interested in sponsoring BOSC, please contact us at [bosc@open-bio.org](mailto:bosc@open-bio.org)!

Thanks to our 2021 sponsors, we were able to offer free ISMB/ECCB 2021 registration to 20 participants from all over the world!

## What is BOSC?

BOSC is an annual meeting organized by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF), a non-profit, volunteer-run group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development and Open Science within the biological research community.
Whether in-person or online, each BOSC ​includes ​talks,​ ​poster​ ​sessions,​ ​birds-of-a-feather gatherings, and ​lots​ ​of​ ​opportunities​ ​for​ ​networking. It is followed by​ ​collaborative​ ​working​ ​sessions​ ​at the CollaborationFest.​ ​These​ ​events​ ​bring​ ​together​ ​software​ ​engineers,​ ​bioinformaticians,​ ​and​ ​researchers​ ​to collaborate​ ​and​ ​extend​ ​open​ ​source​ ​bioinformatics​ ​tools.

Most years, BOSC has been part of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology meeting (ISMB/ECCB). In 2018, BOSC partnered with the Galaxy Community Conference (GCC) in a very successful joint meeting in Portland, [GCCBOSC 2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/). In July 2020, BOSC again joined forces with GCC to form the [Bioinformatics Community Conference (BCC2020)](https://bcc2020.github.io/). Held online, BCC2020 attracted over 600 participants from 62 countries. [BOSC 2021](/events/bosc-2021/) was part of [ISMB/ECCB 2021](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2021), and took place July 29-30, 2021 (followed by a two-day [CollaborationFest](/events/bosc-2021/collaborationfest/)).

[BOSC 2022](/events/bosc-2022/) was held July 13-14, 2022, as part of [ISMB 2022](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2022) in person in Madison, Wisconsin, USA, and simultaneously online.

[BOSC 2023](/events/bosc-2023/) took place July 24-25, 2023 as part of [ISMB/ECCB 2023](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2023) in Lyon, France and online. Like the previous year, we joined forces with Bio-Ontologies for part of a day!

[BOSC 2024](/events/bosc-2024/), the 25th annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference, will take place July 15-16, 2024 as part of [ISMB 2024](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2024/home) in Montreal, Canada and online.

BOSC​ ​participants​ ​come​ ​from​ ​a​ ​wide​ ​variety​ ​of​ ​research​ ​environments​ ​and​ ​backgrounds:

- Biological​ ​researchers,​ ​students,​ ​and​ ​post-docs​ ​who​ ​​ ​are​ ​learning​ ​bioinformatics​ ​analysis tools and techniques
- Power​ ​bioinformatics​ ​users
- Bioinformatics​ ​tool​ ​and​ ​workflow​ ​developers  

- Bioinformatics​-focused​ ​principal​ ​investigators​ ​and​ ​researchers
- Sequencing​ ​core​ ​facility​ ​staff
- Industry​ ​scientists​ ​and​ ​bioinformaticians
- Data​ ​producers

# Previous Events

The​ ​OBF​ ​has​ ​organized​ ​BOSC​ ​ [every​ ​year​ ​since​ ​2000](/events/bosc/about/).​ From 2000 to 2017 and again in 2019,​ ​BOSC​ ​was ​run​ ​as​ ​part​ ​of​ ​the​ ​large​ ​ISMB conference. In 2018 (and again in 2020) it partnered with the Galaxy Community Conference.​ ​The​ ​OBF​ ​CodeFest​s (now renamed CollaborationFest, or CoFest) have ​been​ ​held​ ​every​ ​year​ after BOSC ​since​ ​2010.  

The table below shows the approximate number of participants in BOSC and the CoFest. Figures​ ​for​ ​the​ ​CoFest​ ​and​ ​BOSC​ ​are​ ​number​ ​of​ ​people​ ​registered​ ​for​ ​at​ ​least​ ​one​ ​day​ ​of​ ​the​ ​meeting.​ ​The​ ​BOSC figures​ ​do​ ​not​ ​include​ ​drop-in​ ​attendees​ ​from​ ​the​ ​parallel​ ​sessions​ ​organized​ ​by​ ​other​ ​groups.​ ​The​ ​figures​ ​for CoFest​ ​do​ ​not​ ​include​ ​remote​ ​participants.
