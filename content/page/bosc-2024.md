**BOSC 2024**, the 25th annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference, took place place July 15-16, 2024, as part of [ISMB 2024](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2024/), in Montréal, Canada and online. BOSC covers open source bioinformatics and open science. The theme for 2024 was Open Approaches to AI/ML; it was reflected in a [panel discussion](/events/bosc-2024/bosc-2024-panel) and a talk session.

Videos of the talks from BOSC 2024 are available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@OBFBOSC/). Our report about BOSC 2024 is [published in F1000Research](https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1100).



**[BOSC 2025](/events/bosc-2025/)**
will take place July 21-22, 2025, in Liverpool, UK (as part of ISMB/ECCB 2025).

## About BOSC

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) has been [held annually since 2000](/events/bosc/about/). BOSC is organized by the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)](/wiki/Main_Page), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of open source software development and open science within the biological research community.

Since its inception, BOSC has provided a forum for developers and users to interact and share research results and ideas in open source bioinformatics. BOSC’s broad spectrum of topics includes practical techniques for solving bioinformatics problems; software development practices; standards and ontologies; approaches that promote open science and sharing of data, results and software; and ways to grow open source communities while promoting diversity within them.

BOSC is usually preceded or followed by what we now call [CollaborationFest](/events/bosc-2024/obf-bosc-collaborationfest-2024/) ( [CoFest](/events/bosc-2024/obf-bosc-collaborationfest-2024/) for short), a two-day community development session. This is an opportunity for anyone interested in open science, biology and programming to meet, talk and work collaboratively. All are welcome to attend CoFest, whether or not you attend BOSC!
