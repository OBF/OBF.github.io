**About BOSC**

Since 2000, BOSC has provided a forum for sharing ideas and results in open-source bioinformatics and open science. Our annual two-day program includes keynote talks, talks chosen from submitted abstracts, posters, a panel discussion, and more!

## **Exciting news for 2025**:

BOSC 2025 will include a **joint session with the newly renamed Bio-Ontologies and Knowledge Representation COSI!**

Plus, our popular **collaborative work event (CollaborationFest, or CoFest) will be held as part of ISMB,** with participation open to all. Don't miss this great opportunity to connect with fellow researchers, contribute to groundbreaking projects, and shape the future of bioinformatics!

**Nominate a keynote speaker!**

We would like to assemble a diverse list of potential BOSC 2025 keynote speakers **(see [our open selection process and rubric](https://github.com/OBF/bosc_materials/blob/master/invited-speaker-process.md)).** We invite the community to nominate keynote speakers using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSchUjaUlZw9n05kinPrYOohqukURIJrK6y662E2jjqUlT1dRQ/viewform) by January 16. After that, we will share our list and solicit comments from the community prior to finalizing the speakers.

**Submit an abstract! (But not yet!)**

Abstract submission will open around the end of January. We encourage you to **submit abstracts (due April 17**– no extensions) on any topic relevant to open-source bioinformatics or open science. Some abstracts will be selected for lightning talks, longer talks, or posters.

**BOSC topics include** (but are not limited to):

- Open Science and Reproducible Research
- Open Biomedical Data
- Citizen/Participatory Science
- Standards and Interoperability
- Data Science
- Workflows
- Open Approaches to Translational Bioinformatics
- Open Science
- Developer Tools and Libraries
- Inclusion, Outreach, and Training
- AI/ML: open approaches

Registration fee assistance is available (more info on that soon).

We hope to see you (in person or virtually) at BOSC 2025!
