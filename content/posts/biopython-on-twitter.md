Just to let you all know, [Biopython is now on twitter](http://twitter.com/Biopython). And in case you missed the [OBF announcement](/news/2009/02/hello-twitter-world/) last month, so is the [O\|B\|F News feed](http://twitter.com/obf_news) (and [BioPerl](http://twitter.com/bioperl)). You are welcome to follow us (all) on [twitter](http://twitter.com/).

I'd also like to remind people there are news feeds for the [Biopython news posts](http://news.open-bio.org/news/category/obf-projects/biopython/) (as [RDF](http://news.open-bio.org/news/category/obf-projects/biopython/feed/rdf), [RSS](http://news.open-bio.org/news/category/obf-projects/biopython/feed/rss/), [RSS2](http://news.open-bio.org/news/category/obf-projects/biopython/feed/rss2/), or [Atom](http://news.open-bio.org/news/category/obf-projects/biopython/feed/atom) format). We're planning to have these automatically echoed onto twitter in future... _(update)_ ...and that seems to be working now :)
