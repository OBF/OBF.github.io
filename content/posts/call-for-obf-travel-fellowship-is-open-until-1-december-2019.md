The call for [OBF travel fellowship](/travel-awards/) to select the next round of awardees is officially open! Please submit your application by filling out [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/btbOOfkVcXVzZXxD2). Deadline for this round is **1 December 2019**.

This fellowship aims to support our community members in attending events that promote open source software development and/or open science in the biological research fields. As the organiser of [Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC)](/wiki/BOSC) since 2000, OBF understands the role of such conferences and wants to support people who can benefit from showcasing their work, learn from each other and promote open science at BOSC or similar events.

Applications are particularly encouraged from members from historically underrepresented groups, who work in low-income research environments and strive to promote diversity and inclusion in their communities. The conference or event that the applicants intend to attend must take place in 2020 (preferably during the first half of the year) and should provide them with a platform to learn or promote open science.

Since 2018, OBF has offered this fellowship to **12 awardees** to defray or subsidize their travel-related cost of up to **$1000 each**. You can read their blog posts in [OBF blog](/category/travel-fellowship/) where they have shared their experiences from attending different events as OBF travel fellows.

In 2020, there will be two application calls that will close on 1 March and 1 September 2020. \[ **NOTE**: This was later changed to 1 April and 1 October.\] Please read more details on the [fellowship program](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/master/Travel_fellowships.md) and feel free to contact the committee by writing an email to [board@open-bio.org](mailto:board@open-bio.org).
