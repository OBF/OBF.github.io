title: NCICB reviews two LSID Resolution proposals
url: /2003/03/16/ncicb-reviews-two-lsid-resolution-proposals/

---
Members of the caCORE team at the NCICB have been discussing if and how best
to use LSIDs. Attached is an analysis of the two LSID Resolution proposals.
The document also includes brief descriptions of two use cases that seem
appropriate to us. We would be very interested in any responses to this
analysis.

The document is also available at:
