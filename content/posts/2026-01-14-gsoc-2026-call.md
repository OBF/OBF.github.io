# GSoC 2026: Call for Projects, Mentors, and Co-Admins

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) plans to participate in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2026 and invites community members to propose project ideas, volunteer as mentors, or help as co-administrators. Per the official [GSoC 2026](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2026) timeline, organization applications close on February 3. You can view examples of OBF’s previously accepted projects here: [OBF at GSoC 2022](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/organizations/open-bioinformatics-foundation-obf).
