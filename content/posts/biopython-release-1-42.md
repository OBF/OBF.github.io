Dear biopythoneers,

We are pleased to announce the release of Biopython 1.42. This release includes a brand-new Genbank parser in Bio.GenBank by Peter Cock, numerous updates to Bio.Nexus by Frank Kauff and to Bio.Geo by Peter, lots of bug fixes by scores of contributors through BugZilla, and Bio.Cluster became object-oriented.

Source distributions and Windows installers are available from our spiffy new Wiki-based website at http://biopython.org. My thanks to all code contributors who made this new release possible.

--Michiel on behalf of the Biopython developers
