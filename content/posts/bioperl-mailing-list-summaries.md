The first of a biweekly summary of BioPerl mailing list summaries has been posted to the wiki:

- [April 1-11](http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/BioPerl_Mailing_List_Summaries_for_April_1-11)

These will likely be archived [on the wiki](http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Mailing_list_summaries) but may be moved to a more suitable location in the future (maybe to this blog?).
