**Overview of the round 2 of OBF Event Fellowship 2022**

The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) Event Fellowship program](/event-awards/) is now in its 8th year. In the last year, we had two calls for applications, with deadlines on 1 April and 1 October in 2022. Starting in 2023, **we will open three calls for applications** with the following deadlines: 1 April, 1 August, and 1 December.

In 2022 round 2 (October 2022), we received 23 applications, of which three applicants were awarded this fellowship for various events they were participating in. Congratulations to **Winfred Gatua**, **Luise Rauer,** and **Ruth Nanjala**.

**Nehemiah Ongeso Mosioma** was also approved to attend Vienna BioCenter PhD Program Symposium "Pushing Boundaries", but due to admin oversight, they could not attend the event. The OBF Fellowship Award chairs are discussing how we can redirect this award towards another event the awardee might be able to attend.

We have recently published a blog post from one of our latest awardees summarising their experience attending a conference with help from an OBF Event Fellowship:

Congratulations to all of our awardees!  We are delighted to support their participation with OBF Event Fellowships, and we wish them all the best for their future work.

**Please share this post and apply for the fellowship before 1 April 2023**.
