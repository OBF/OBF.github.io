Bioperl developers are preparing a 1.5 release, you can grab the pre-release for testing at [http://bioperl.org/DIST](http://bioperl.org/DIST). We would greatly appreciate you downloading and testing this code before it is released by running 'make test'.

See [Aaron's post](http://portal.open-bio.org/pipermail/bioperl-l/2004-November/017351.html) announcing the RC1 candidate.
