Just a friendly reminder that abstracts for BOSC 2010 are due next Thursday, April 15.  See the BOSC web site at /wiki/BOSC\_2010 for details.  Submissions will only be accepted electronically at http://events.open-bio.org/BOSC2010/openconf.php.

Graduate students, don't forget we are offering $250 student travel awards this year. Be sure to check the box indicating that you are a graduate student to be considered for the award.

We are also pleased to announce that Guy Coates, Group leader of the Informatics Systems Group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, and Ross Gardler, Vice President of the Apache Software Foundation, will be giving keynote presentations at BOSC.

On behalf of the BOSC 2010 organizing committee, I hope to see you there!
