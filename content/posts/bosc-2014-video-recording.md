![](/w/images/thumb/b/b0/Pear.png/100px-Pear.png)We're pleased to publicly announce that we aim to video record _all_ the talks at [BOSC 2014](/wiki/BOSC_2014_Schedule), and the panel discussion, to be made freely available online after the conference. This is on an opt-out basis, and thus far none of our speakers have declined to be filmed. [![YouTube](https://news.obf.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/YouTube2.png)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNSng3q18VuQ-13RhhKJ5FA "OBF videos on YouTube.com") Last year we managed to record many of the talks - including both keynotes, which you can watch via the YouTube links on the [BOSC 2013 Schedule](/wiki/BOSC_2013_Schedule). This year we are hiring a professional from [Next Day Video](http://nextdayvideo.com/) ( [@NextDayVideo](https://twitter.com/nextdayvideo) on Twitter).
