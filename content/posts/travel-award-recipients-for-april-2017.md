We had a huge response to this round of the [OBF travel award](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/master/Travel_fellowships.md). After reviewing the applications, the OBF board selected four recipients. Three applicants accepted awards, and all plan to use the funds to attend [this year's BOSC](/wiki/BOSC_2017), to take place July 22-23 in Prague.

Congratulations to our spring 2017 recipients:

- Sourav Singh, who will participate in the Codefest and present the [Biopython](http://biopython.org/) Project Update 2017 talk
- Jonathan Sobel, presenting on a citizen science project named [BeerDeCoded](http://www.genome.beer/), carried out by members of the Swiss non-profit called the Hackuarium
- Jiwen Xin, presenting the [BioThings Explorer](http://biothings.io/) project, which integrates genomic data via public APIs

We encourage everyone at BOSC to come out and support our award winners! After BOSC, watch for blog posts from each of the awardees.

The next deadline for travel awards is August 15. You can apply to travel to participate at any event that develops or promotes open source development and open science in the biological research community. See the [OBF travel award](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/master/Travel_fellowships.md) page for details and link to application.
