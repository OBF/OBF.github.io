Todd Harris has released
[GD::SVG](http://toddot.net/projects/GD-SVG/index.shtml)
in
[CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/author/TWH/GD-SVG-0.19/). This module implements support for most features of GD that are used by Bio::Graphics (together with the
[SVG](http://search.cpan.org/author/RONAN/SVG-2.27/) module).

Try out the publication publication quality graphics
directly from
[CVS](http://cvs.bioperl.org/) and help to squash the last bugs before stable bioperl release. See `all_glyphs.pl` and `dynamic_glyphs.pl` in `examples/biographics` directory.
