Hi all,

You may have noticed we're trying out using the wiki for [Biopython cookbook entries](http://biopython.org/wiki/Category:Cookbook). It's a new idea so at the moment there are only a few 'recipes' on offer. If you have some tricks you find yourself using time and again to solve a problem why not share them? Similarly, if you find yourself coming up against a problem you can't seem to solve easily with Biopython's tools send a message to one of the [mailing lists](http://biopython.org/wiki/Mailing_lists) proposing it as a cookbook example and someone just might solve it for you!

There are also several short examples in the main " [Biopython Tutorial and Cookbook](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html)" ( [pdf version](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf)) which might be worth copying/moving to the wiki. What would you pick from here?

Feedback from [Biopython](http://www.biopython.org) newcomers would be especially valuable!  :)
