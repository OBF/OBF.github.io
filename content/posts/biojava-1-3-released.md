  After a long series of pre-releases (and many bug fixes), I've
  just finished building BioJava 1.30. Source, binaries, and
  javadocs can all be found at:

  http://www.biojava.org/download/

  As with the pre-releases, separate binaries are available for
  java platform releases 1.3 and 1.4. The 1.4 releases include
  some extra features which depend on jdk1.4 extensions such
  as the java.nio package.

  Highlights of this release include:

  \- Packed storage of sequence data in memory

  \- Better support for the OBDA database access standards

  \- Improvements to the parsers for output from tools like
  blast and fasta.

  \- Many enhancements to the FeatureFilter system.

Please check out the javadocs for information on these and
other new features.

I'd also like to take this opportunity to recomment the
excellent BioJava in Anger website, which is now hosted
on biojava.org:
