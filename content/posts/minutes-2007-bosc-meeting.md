**Attending:** Jason Stajich (OBF President), Hilmar Lapp (OBF Parliamentarian), Darin London, Kam Dahlquist

### BOSC

- Had 94 attendees registered specifically for BOSC as of July 9th
- Do we have an audience? Is there a niche that BOSC continues to fill? The numbers seem to speak a clear voice.
- Show-and-tell was received positively, but didn't play as big a role anymore
- Want to continue running the conference
- Venue:
  - Seems much favorable to associate with an existing major event
  - One model could be to associate with different events on an alternating basis, such as IMSB every other year and a different conference every other year
- Need a new Organizing Committee, several people volunteered to help organizing
  - Committee should decide on sessions, timetable, outreach venues
  - Session chairs who are also charged to identify the most desirable speakers
  - Should have budget to reimburse travel for key speakers who otherwise wouldn't be able to come
  - Need to look into venue and procedure for publishing the talks
  - Include a hackathon?

**Action items:**

- Darin to craft on-line feedback survey for BOSC
- Darin to draft initial call for nomination to the BOSC Organizing Committee (BOC)
- Darin to collate required responsibilities for the BOC in the run up to the conference

### Open-Bio Board

- Membership of the BOD
  - Current members are technically Jason Stajich, Chris Dagdigian, Andrew Dalke, Ewan Birney, Hilmar Lapp
  - Steven Brenner resigned in 2006.
- Financial report:
  - Have $15k in the bank.
  - Have not filed a tax report since incorporation.
  - Need to hire an accountant (for filing tax reports), lawyer (re-incorporate).
  - (Paste points from Chris' letter here)

### Mission of the organization

- Want do continue what we do right now, i.e., infrastructure support for the projects
  - Should ask project leaders for what they need
- Should we take a more active role?
  - Public opinion forming on open source software?
  - Should be present at the open-source panel
  - Outreach and education?
- Advertising and outreach for BOSC is also advertising for OBF
  - Makes us appear on people's minds, something that people want to be a part of
  - Regular letters about news of BOSC
  - OBF official blog?
- Community building:
  - Creating ways for people to reach others
  - Providing a forum for people to engage in discourse about how to advance the state of open source in bioinformatics
  - Connect possibly "competing" projects to make an attempt at advancing the quality and availability of software
  - Coordinate meet-ups of people at other events (other than BOSC)
  - Must not be exclusive or ideologic
- Create a year-long plan leading up to BOSC 2008
  - Generate excitement
  - Need mechanism to identify who is currently on the board
  - Need mechanism to identify those who aren't contributing, and remove them from board
  - Need to identify new treasurer
  - Need to identify candidates who would like to serve on the board
  - Revitalize and reform the board
