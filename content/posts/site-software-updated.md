I've updated the wordpress install to [2.0](http://wordpress.org/development/2005/12/wp2/) which has a lot more features and seems to be better setup for permissions and what not.

I also upgraded the [wiki](/wiki) to [1.5.5](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) to deal with some [potential security holes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Metafile_vulnerability) with [WMF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Metafile) files.

I also changed the permalink structure so that the links are informative by date and post-slug. I like this much more.
