#### Abstract

The [Ersilia Open-Source Initiative](https://www.ersilia.io/) is a non-profit organisation whose mission is to equip laboratories, clinics and universities in lower and middle income countries (LMICs) with artificial intelligence (AI) tools for infectious disease research. The goal of our mission is to strengthen the research capacity in those countries where these diseases are predominant, supporting the in-country drug discovery pipelines for neglected and infectious diseases. Since its foundation in 2020, we have collaborated with several institutions in the Global South as well as international consortiums. In this introductory talk we will present our computational approach and infrastructure, including the Ersilia Model Hub, a unified platform offering ready- to-use AI models to researchers worldwide, and how we have used it across multiple projects, offering a perspective on how AI/ML can transform drug discovery and contribute towards a more egalitarian world of biomedical research.

#### About the speaker

Trained as a molecular biologist, Gemma Turon completed a PhD in colorectal cancer and stem cells at IRB Barcelona in 2019, before taking a one-year break to focus on working and volunteering in the third sector. This shifted her scientific interest to global health and neglected diseases, and the existing barriers to tackle some of the most urgent health issues in developing countries. With Ersilia, she aims to explore new ways of community building and engagement in the scientific arena, at the intersection between academia, biotech start-ups and NPOs.

#### ISCBacademy
