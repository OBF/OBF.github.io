#### Guest post by Thomas Schlapp, CoFest organizer

This year we're looking to have another post-BOSC [CoFest](/events/bosc-2022/obf-bosc-collaborationfest/)! Last year (my first year being involved in BOSC at all) showed me just how collaborative and innovative this community can be. I'd absolutely LOVE to see more of it again. Last year we saw six very fascinating projects see progress (look them over [HERE](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10blW3DVEIUArq12mrKf-PIJQNn01GOSmGOH8d7sCUWo/edit?usp=sharing)!). Let's see if we cannot do just a few more in the name of innovation and collaboration!

[CoFest 2022](/events/bosc-2022/obf-bosc-collaborationfest/) will take place the two days after BOSC/ISMB: July 15-16, 2022. We are trying to determine whether there is sufficient interest in holding the CoFest in person in Madison, Wisconsin; if not, it will be virtual.

Please please please [REGISTER](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h5woYd0URjgUKInWA2sozDwfThUlQbQQ9xbjdEdQQXk/edit#gid=0) if you want to be a part of this awesome community remote or on-site! Do you have a project to add? Great! Are you alone but want to help in some way? Equally awesome! Head over to this set of slides ( [Submissions!](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x0YW49aUG7FKL1vZh62Ct0rTW-0jH-ipIDWzoFs9_nc/edit?usp=sharing)) and add yourself or your project!

Thank you again BOSC community for allowing me the opportunity to help CoFest manifest.
