title: Weekly Mailing List Traffic Summaries

I plan on starting a weekly, possibly biweekly, summary of mailing list traffic. These will be somewhat in the same vein as the [Perl5](http://dev.perl.org/perl5/list-summaries/) or [Perl6](http://dev.perl.org/perl6/list-summaries/) summaries and will be posted on the blog here and sent to the bioperl-l mail list. Barring another [natural disaster here](http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WEATHER/04/02/midwest.tornadoes/), these should start up next week (covering mail list traffic starting from April 1). The summaries will cover traffic mainly from [bioperl-l](http://bioperl.org/mailman/listinfo/bioperl-l) (the main mail list) but will include [biosql-l](http://bioperl.org/mailman/listinfo/biosql-l), since it's fairly low traffic, and bugs/module updates from [bioperl-guts-l.](http://bioperl.org/mailman/listinfo/bioperl-guts-l)

Drop a comment on the list to let me know if there are any requests/questions/gripes/etc.
