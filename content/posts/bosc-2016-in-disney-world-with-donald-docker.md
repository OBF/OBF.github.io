First I would like to congratulate OBF that supports diversity in the community with its [travel awards initiative](https://news.open-bio.org/2016/03/01/obf-travel-fellowship-program/). I was very pleased to be one of the [three travel fellowship awardees](https://news.open-bio.org/2016/05/23/first-obf-travel-fellowships/). Thank you OBF! Ιt was great to attend [BOSC 2016](/wiki/BOSC_2016) and meet remarkable people and know their work.It was one of the most welcoming meetings I have attended and Ι liked that is was active on the social media and the conference materials and speaker presentations were available online. It made it fun and useful and we could focus less on our notebooks and more on the speakers. Τhis also attracted a lot of positive comments from the other Special Interest Groups. So “Bravo” to the organizers!On the scientific part, it was nice to see Docker making an impression on the bioinformatics community. Everyone was talking about it. It is an awesome way to package bioinformatics applications and the fact that it received so much attention got me pretty excited. I am planning to use it to package CollOS, an open source web application I presented at the conference, that tracks, annotates and barcodes biological samples to facilitate wet lab scientists to locate and identify biological samples.Last but definitely not least, I would like to congratulate Mónica Muñoz-Torres and the organizers for their reference to the recent tragic shooting incident in Orlando.Hope to see you next year in Prague!Dimitra
