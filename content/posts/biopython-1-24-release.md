New parsers for Phred and Ace format files -- thanks to Frank Kauff
New Code for dealing with NMR data -- thanks to Bob Bussell
New SeqUtils modules for codon usage, isoelectric points and other
protein properties -- thanks to Yair Benita
New code for dealing with Wise contributed by Michael
EZ-Retrieve sequence retrieval now supported thanks to Jeff
Bio.Cluster updated along with documentation by Michiel
BioSQL fixed so it now works with the current SQL schema -- thanks to Yves
Bastide for patches
