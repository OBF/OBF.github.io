I'm happy to announce a new release of Biopython 1.30, available
today from http://biopython.org. This release contains a number of
new modules and substantial changes to older modules. As a result of
the changes, we've bumped up to a brand new major number. Please do
download, test with your code, and report any bugs or problems to
the normal lists (biopython at biopython.org or
biopython-dev at biopython.org). For the full details about changes, please see:
