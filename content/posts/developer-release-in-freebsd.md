The Developer Release (1.5.1) of BioPerl has been brought back into the [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org/) [Ports Collection](http://www.freebsd.org/ports/). For instructions on how to install it, please take a look into the [Getting Bioperl](/wiki/Getting_BioPerl) section of the [BioPerl Wiki](/wiki/Main_Page).

We encourage people who is taking care of creating packages for other platforms (specific Linux distributions, Mac OS, Windows, etc.) to put in the wiki the necessary documentation about getting and installing BioPerl releases in your favorite OS/distributions.
