title: Domain names available for adoption

The OBF has two sets of domain names available for adoption by a non-profit or open source project: biows.org, biows.com, biows.net and biocpp.org, biocpp.com, biocpp.net

These domains were registered and donated to us with bio-web-services (biows) and bio-c-plus-plus (BioC++ or BioCPP) in mind, but we've failed to find a good home for them.

Please note that this is like adopting a free puppy - we'll transfer them at no cost, but domain names come with annual renewal charges which the recipient organisation would be responsible for paying.

Serious enquiries to the OBF board by email by the end of February 2020 please.
