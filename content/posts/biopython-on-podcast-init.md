[Podcast.\_\_init\_\_](https://www.podcastinit.com/) describes itself as _"The Podcast About Python and the People Who Make It Great"_, and the most recent episode is " [Biopython with Peter Cock, Wibowo Arindrarto, and Tiago Ant√£o (Episode 125)](https://www.podcastinit.com/biopython-with-peter-cock-wibowo-andrarto-and-tiago-antao-episode-125/)".

Listening to the finished podcast, interviewer Tobias Macey did a great job. There are things I would have liked to have said - but it turned out pretty well. I hope you'll agree:

Its worth looking back over the podcast archives, here are a few that caught my eye:

- [Coverage.py with Ned Batchelder (Episode 121)](https://www.podcastinit.com/coverage-py-with-ned-batchelder-episode-121/)
- [Scikit-Image with Stefan van der Walt and Juan Nunez-Iglesias (Episode 105)](https://www.podcastinit.com/episode-105-scikit-image-with-stefan-van-der-walt-and-juan-nunez-iglesias/)
- [Pandas with Jeff Reback (Episode 98)](https://www.podcastinit.com/episode-98-pandas-with-jeff-reback/)
