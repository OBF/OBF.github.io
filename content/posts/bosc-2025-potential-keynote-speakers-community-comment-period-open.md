We invited our community to nominate potential keynote speakers for BOSC, and we were delighted with the many excellent suggestions received. In the next stage of this process, we're providing you with an opportunity to express any concerns regarding the suitability of any nominated individuals as BOSC Keynote Speakers.

Our [invited speaker selection process and criteria](https://github.com/OBF/bosc_materials/blob/master/invited-speaker-process.md) include examples of potential reasons for exclusion. **If you have concerns about any of the individuals on our list, please share them (with as much detail as you feel comfortable providing) through [this anonymous form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3hUXZ5BQv2-I7DpL-SdEovAVh6Bq9wWgs93FMx5LylAC_Eg/viewform) by Friday, January 24, 2025.**

**And the nominees are…**

- Aitana Neves
- Alondra Nelson
- Aviv Regev
- Catalina Lopez-Correa
- Chris Mungall
- Christine Orengo
- Dorrie Main
- Francis Ouelette
- Guanming Wu
- Heidi Sofia
- Helen Parkinson
- Joslynn Lee
- Kari Jordan
- Lincoln Stein
- Lisa Bowleg
- Mallory Freeberg
- Robert Aboukhalil
- Rowland Mosbergen
- Susanna Sansone
- Susheel Varma
- Sushma Naithani
- Tanya Berardini
- X. Shirley Liu

Following the close of the community comment period, the BOSC Organizing Committee will use this list as a starting point for extending invitations to potential keynote speakers. As we cannot predict which speakers will accept the invitation, we may need to consider individuals beyond those nominated. In such cases, we will not repeat this nomination process. However, community members are always encouraged to inform the Organizing Committee if they believe a speaker does not align with our established standards.
