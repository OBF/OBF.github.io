Hello all,

I'm very pleased and excited to announce that the Open Bioinformatics Foundation has selected 5 very capable students to work on OBF projects this summer as part of the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program](http://code.google.com/soc/).

The accepted students, their projects, and their mentors (in alphabetical order):

- **[Wibowo Arindrarto](http://bow.web.id/blog/tag/gsoc/)**:  
_SearchIO Implementation in Biopython_  
mentored by Peter Cock
- **[Lenna Peterson](http://arklenna.tumblr.com/tagged/gsoc2012)**:  
_Diff My DNA: Development of a Genomic Variant Toolkit for Biopython_  
mentored by Brad Chapman, Reece Hart, James Casbon
- **[Marjan Povolni](http://blog.mpthecoder.com/tagged/gsoc)**:  
_The worlds fastest parallelized GFF3/GTF parser in D, and an interfacing biogem plugin for Ruby_  
mentored by Pjotr Prins, Francesco Strozzi, Raoul Bonnal
- **[Artem Tarasov](http://lomereiter.wordpress.com/tag/gsoc/)**:  
_Fast parallelized GFF3/GTF parser in C++, with Ruby FFI bindings_  
mentored by Pjotr Prins, Francesco Strozzi, Raoul Bonnal
- **[Clayton Wheeler](http://csw.github.com/bioruby-maf/)**:  
_Multiple Alignment Format parser for BioRuby_  
mentored by Francesco Strozzi and Raoul Bonnal

As in every year, we received many great applications and ideas. However, funding and mentor resources are limited, and we were not able to accept as many as we would have liked. Our deepest thanks to all the students who applied: we sincerely appreciate the time and effort you put into your applications, and hope you will still consider being a part of the OBF's open source projects, even without Google funding. I speak for myself and all of the mentors who read and scored applications when I say that we were truly honored by the number and quality of the applications we received.

For the accepted students: congratulations! You have risen to the top of a very competitive application process. Now it's time to "put your money where your mouth is", as the saying goes. Let's get out there and write some great code this summer!

Best regards,

Robert Buels
