![sarah-hird](https://news.obf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/sarah-hird.jpeg)The [BOSC 2015](/wiki/BOSC_2015) Organizing Committee is pleased to welcome [Sarah Hird](https://sites.google.com/site/sarahhird/home "Sarah Hird") as our new Outreach Coordinator. BOSC is eager to increase the participation of individuals and groups that have been historically underrepresented at our conferences, and Sarah will be spearheading this effort.

Sarah is currently a UC Davis Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellow with Jonathan Eisen in the UC Davis Genome Center, where her research interests lie at the intersection of phylogeography, bioinformatics and microbial diversity. Â She earned her PhD in biology and bioinformatics at LSU. Sarah is also known for her focus on [promoting diversity in STEM](https://sites.google.com/site/sarahhird/diversity-in-stem). "I am personally and professionally interested in how we can make "the Academy" a more representative sample of the world around us," she says.

Please join us in welcoming Sarah to the [BOSC](/wiki/BOSC_2015) organizing committee, and stay tuned for more information about BOSC 2015 (which will take place July 10-11, 2015, in Dublin).
