The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is sponsored by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O\|B\|F), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development within the biological research community. To be considered for acceptance, software systems representing the central topic in a presentation submitted to BOSC must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be freely available for download in source code form.

We invite you to submit one-page abstracts for talks and posters. This year's session topics are:

- Cloud and Parallel Computing
- Linked Data
- Genome-scale Data Management
- Data Visualization and Imaging
- Translational Bioinformatics
- Software Interoperability (possibly a joint session with [BSI-SIG, the Bioinformatics Software Interoperability SIG](http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/bsi-sig/))
- Bioinformatics Open Source Project Updates
- Interfacing with Industry (panel)

Thanks to generous sponsorship from [Eagle Genomics](http://eaglegenomics.com/) and an anonymous donor, we are pleased to announce a competition for three Student Travel Awards. Each winner will be awarded $250 to defray the costs of travel to BOSC 2012.
