[BCC2020](http://bcc2020.github.io/) (the collaborative BOSC + GCC meeting) was held online, with over 800 people registered for some part of the meeting. We used [Remo.co](http://remo.co/) as the technology platform, along with Discord for chat. Read about why we chose those, how it worked out, and our tips for others who are organizing virtual conferences [here](https://bcc2020.github.io/blog/lessons-learnt).
