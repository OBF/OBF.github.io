We have successfully crowd-sourced a new OBF logo! The process started at the [OBF Birds of a Feather meeting](https://news.open-bio.org/2018/07/09/following-up-from-boscs-obf-birds-of-a-feather-meeting/)Â at [GCCBOSC 2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) when the OBF leaders announced that we were seeking a new logo design. Two BoF participants immediately started sketching ideas, as well as a third community member who was not at the BoF but saw our tweet. The designs (which you can see [here](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/issues/43)) were put up for a public vote. [Aleix Lafita](https://github.com/lafita)'s narrowly won and was adopted as our new OBF logo! We are currently working on possible variations on the logo for special events or causes (for example, a rainbow version).

The OBF is delighted that community members responded to our request for new logo designs with creativity and focus--attributes that are valuable in the open source community.
