The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) Event Fellowship program](/event-awards/) is now in its 7th year. Starting in 2023, we open three calls for applications with the following deadlines: 1 April, 1 August, and 1 December.

In 2023 round 2 (August 2023), we received numerous applications, of which one applicant was awarded this fellowship for the event they were participating in. Congratulations to **Raquel Manzano Garcia.** This fellowship will support her participation in the Nextflow summit, where she will be presenting her work on “Development of an Integrated DNA and RNA Variant Calling Pipeline”.

We recently published blog posts from three of our recent awardees summarising their experiences attending conferences with help from OBF Event Fellowships:
