GO::TermFinder will take a list of genes (any name that appears in
an annotation file will do, though there are caveats for ambiguous names),
an ontology file, and an annotation file, and determine the P\_values for
the observed frequency of annotation to those genes for each GO node.
There are currently some differences between how the P-values are
