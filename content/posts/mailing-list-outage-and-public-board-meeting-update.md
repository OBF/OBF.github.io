title: Mailing list outage, and public board meeting update

This time of year we'd normally be having a public board meeting as part of our commitment to communication with our member projects and the wider OBF community. As per our bylaws we notify the community at least 10 days in advance, and we'd also handle election of new board members and leadership changes where appropriate. For a couple of reasons, we're going to postpone that until early 2018.

Our mailing list server (which hosts many of our member project lists) has been overwhelmed in the past few days, leading to delayed or blocked communication not just to our members but for our member projects who rely on it. We're looking into options for solving this problem, which might include migrating to a hosted solution.

This comes at the same time that the OBF board has been taking a look at how best to direct the organisation as we move forward. We'd like to have that conversation with our members _after_ we've crystallised our thoughts a bit, and we're still in the process of doing that.

As we're sorting this out, we decided to push the public meeting back to early 2018 so everyone involved can get the most out of it. We hope you understand, and we're looking forward to hearing from as many of you as we can at that meeting.
