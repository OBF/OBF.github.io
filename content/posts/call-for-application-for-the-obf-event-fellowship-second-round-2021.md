The call for application for the second round of this year's [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](https://www.open-bio.org) (OBF) Event Fellowship is open. Please submit your application before **October 1, 2021** (save a calendar reminder).

Just announced: deadline extended to October 4, 2021!

**Please apply via this Google application form: [https://forms.gle/7ocmgvypiFHeFNfy7](https://forms.gle/7ocmgvypiFHeFNfy7).**

The OBF Event Fellowship program is aimed at increasing diverse participation at events promoting open science practices such as open source bioinformatics resource development and dissemination in the biological research community. These fellowships are available to support both in-person and remote (virtual) participation at events such as conferences, workshops, training courses or collaborative development sprints. See more details on [our webpage](/event-awards/).

Like the previous three rounds, we are continuing to invite applications from individuals seeking financial support to attend or host virtual events.

In the previous rounds, we have offered fellowships to participants in bioinformatics, open research and life science-related projects or conferences. This fellowship supported their participation as a speaker, poster presenter or new learners of these particular topics. You can [read blogposts](/blog/) from their participation.

If multiple members of a group are applying for this fellowship, please send your applications separately as the OBF Event Fellowship is aimed at supporting **individual applicants only**. For more information, please contact the OBF Event Fellowship chair by emailing: [board@open-bio.org](mailto:board@open-bio.org).
