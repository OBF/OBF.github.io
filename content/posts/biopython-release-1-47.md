We are pleased to announce the release of Biopython 1.47.

This release includes a new [Bio.AlignIO](http://biopython.org/wiki/AlignIO) module, updates to Bio.Blast, parsers for NCBI's Entrez E-Utilities, numerous other code improvements and fixes, and an extended and updated documentation. In particular if you use Biopython to access NCBI's E-Utilities, we encourage you to download and install this release to ensure full compliance with NCBI's access rules.

Source distributions and Windows installers are available from the Biopython website at [http://biopython.org](http://biopython.org). My thanks to all code contributors who made this new release possible.
