title: Call for applications for OBF Event Fellowship, Round 1 of 2021

The call for applications for the OBF Event Fellowship 2021, round 1 is now open. **The deadline for this round is 1 April 2021.** Applications should be submitted via [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/ppExEeJpx8UDMWQB6).

We invite applications from candidates who are seeking financial support to attend or host virtual events in 2021. The selected awardees can use the OBF Event Fellowship to cover conference registration fees and potentially additional expenses associated with attending or hosting the event, such as small hardware (microphone, speaker, webcam), childcare for the duration of the event and high-speed internet. Like last year, in this round, we will consider applications to attend or host virtual events only. This decision has been made due to the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic induced lockdown and restricted travels. Expenses that will be incurred by remote participation have to be justified in the application and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

**Group applications are not in scope, but:** if multiple members of the same group would like to attend the same event, each member should send their application separately. If members of an organising committee would like to apply for support for hosting an event, the application should be sent by one person (preferably the lead organiser).

**Planning to attend** [**BOSC 2021**](/events/bosc-2021/) **?** You can request a registration fee waiver/reduction when submitting your abstract for a talk or poster directly via the [BOSC abstract submission form](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ismbeccb2021abstracts). If you would like to participate without a talk or poster, please fill the OBF Event Fellowship [application form](https://forms.gle/ppExEeJpx8UDMWQB6) providing your motivation and expected outcomes from attending BOSC 2021.

More details regarding the fellowship application, review, and reimbursement process can be foundon our website: [/event-awards/](/event-awards/). If you have questions, please contact the OBF board by emailing [board@open-bio.org](mailto:board@open-bio.org).
