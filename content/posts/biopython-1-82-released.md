Biopython 1.82 has been released and is available from our [website](https://biopython.org/wiki/Download) and [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/biopython/1.82).

Our second release of 2023 is now out, albeit way later than we'd all intended.

This contains about 10 months worth of updates, so the NEWS file information is denser than usual: [https://github.com/biopython/biopython/blob/biopython-182/NEWS.rst](https://github.com/biopython/biopython/blob/biopython-182/NEWS.rst)

Also, there have been more deprecations and removals of deprecated code than typical - see the DEPRECATED file too: [https://github.com/biopython/biopython/blob/biopython-182/DEPRECATED.rst](https://github.com/biopython/biopython/blob/biopython-182/DEPRECATED.rst)
