##### About BOSC 2021

BOSC is returning to ISMB in 2021, after a successful partnership with Galaxy for the first Bioinformatics Community Conference last year (BCC2020 online). Originally slated to take place in Lyon, France, [ISMB/ECCB 2021](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2021/) will be held online, and features over a dozen tracks, including BOSC. As usual, [BOSC](/events/bosc/) will include keynote talks, longer and shorter (lightning) talks from submitted abstracts, posters, Birds of a Feather, and more!

##### Timing

**BOSC 2021 will take place the last two days of ISMB/ECCB: July 29-30.** Our usual free collaborative work event, [CoFest,](/events/bosc-2021/collaborationfest/) will be held July 31 - August 1.

The complete ISMB/ECCB schedule is available [here](https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2021/schedule/schedule.php). The core hours for talks will be **11:00-15:30 UTC**, with poster sessions and ISMB keynotes from 15:30-17:30 UTC. The core hours correspond to:

13:00-17:30 CEST (Europe)
12:00-16:30 BST (UK/Ireland)
7:00-11:30am EDT (East coast of North America)
4:00-8:30am PDT (West coast of North America)
9:00pm-1:30am AEST (East coast of Australia)

##### Abstract submission

We encourage you to [**submit abstracts**](/events/bosc/submit/) on any topic relevant to open source bioinformatics or open science. After review, some abstracts will be selected for lightning talks, longer talks, or posters. The deadline for abstract submission is **May 6th (11:59pm EDT / 03:59 (May 7th) UTC)!**

**BOSC session topics include** (but are not limited to):

Open Science and Reproducible Research
Open Biomedical Data
Citizen/Participatory Science
Standards and Interoperability
Data Science
Workflows
Open Approaches to Translational Bioinformatics
Open Science for Global Health
Developer Tools and Libraries
Inclusion, Outreach and Training
Bioinformatics Open Source Project Reports (about new or existing projects)

#### Requesting registration fee assistance

We realize that the cost of ISMB/ECCB may be prohibitive for some. If you are [submitting an abstract to BOSC](/events/bosc-2021/submit/) and would have difficulty covering the cost of registration, you can request registration fee assistance. To make it easy, this request can be made right on the abstract submission form. (Only the conference chairs will see these fee assistance requests -- the abstract reviewers will not.) We regret that we will not be able to offer registration fee assistance for those who are not submitting abstracts. (But you should consider submitting an abstract! Even if your work is preliminary, it may qualify for a poster.)
