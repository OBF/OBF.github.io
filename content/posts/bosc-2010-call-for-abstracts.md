The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is sponsored by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O\|B\|F), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development within the biological research community. To be considered for acceptance, software systems representing the central topic in a presentation submitted to BOSC must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be freely available for download in source code form.

We have some exciting things planned this year, including:

- Codefest 2010 programming session for the two days preceeding BOSC:  See [/wiki/Codefest\_2010](/wiki/Codefest_2010) for details.
- OpenBio Solution Challenge:  See session description below and [/wiki/SolutionChallenge](/wiki/SolutionChallenge) for details.
- Student Travel Fellowships:  Through generous sponsorship from Eagle Genomics and an anonymous donor, we are pleased to announce the competition for three Student Travel Awards for BOSC 2010. Each winner will be awarded $250 to defray the costs of travel to BOSC 2010.  See [/wiki/BOSC\_2010#Student\_Travel\_Awards](/wiki/BOSC_2010#Student_Travel_Awards) for details.
- First-ever BOSC Proceedings will be published in the Open Access journal, BMC Bioinformatics.  Manuscripts will be due after BOSC on August 15.  See [/wiki/BOSC\_2010#First-ever\_Published\_BOSC\_Proceedings](/wiki/BOSC_2010#First-ever_Published_BOSC_Proceedings) for details.
- Sessions on approaches to analyzing high-throughput 'omics data, cloud-based approaches to improving software and data accessibility, the semantic web in open source bioinformatics, see below:

We invite abstracts for talks at the following sessions: **OpenBio SolutionChallenge** \-\- Bioinformatics library providers: please join us in a friendly competition to solve a shared biological problem, demonstrating the utility of your toolkit alongside other developers. Instead of the traditional Bio\* updates that we've had at previous conferences, this year, we're planning to organize these talks around a central theme: the OpenBio Solution Challenge. We start with a biological question of general interest, and the project talks will focus around how you would solve that problem using your toolkit and programming language. This is meant to provide a challenge for OpenBio contributors, a nice tutorial style overview of various projects and approaches for other programmers, and a fun opportunity to compete and learn from other projects. Conference attendees will vote on their favorite solution, with the winner receiving fame and fortune (warning: fortune not guaranteed). Specific challenges are being discussed on the SolutionChallenge page and through the various Bio\* mailing lists. Alternately, each project could highlight a challenge that they particularly do well, focusing tutorial-style on how to solve a particular problem.
