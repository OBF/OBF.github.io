So [Mailing list summaries](http://bioperl.org/wiki/Mailing_list_summaries) have stopped because we need someone else to help post these summaries. Not a light job unfortunately. If you are interested, please post to the mailing list or contact Jason, Sendu, or Chris for more details. This is one way you can help BioPerl without contributing code if you aren't comfortable with that type of commitment.

Two things that have been discussed on the mailing list lately are:

- Converting from CVS to SVN for code repository
- [Splitting](http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/bioperl-l/2007-July/026057.html) BioPerl core code ( [bioperl-live](http://code.open-bio.org/cgi/viewcvs.cgi/bioperl-live/) CVS repository) into separate pieces to reduce the number of modules in the "Core" code base.

If you have an opinion about this - please join the discussion on the mailing list.
