---
As previously described, during the November 2021 public Board meeting, [the OBF announced two new initiatives to be voted on by the OBF membership](/2022/01/04/obf-membership-referendum/). Both of these [received a large majority of votes](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/e/obf-coc-css):

1. OBF Community Support Sponsorship (53 for, 3 against, 2 abstaining)
1. OBF Code of Conduct (54 for, 2 against, 1 abstaining)

The work to set up the new Community Support Sponsorship is [underway](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/issues/86). The new Code of Conduct is now available on the [OBF website.](/code-of-conduct/)
