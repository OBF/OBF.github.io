The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) Event Fellowship program](/event-awards/) aims to support and encourage diverse participation at events focusing on open source bioinformatics software development and open science practices in the biological research community. Each year we open two calls for applications, deadlines for which are 1 April and 1 October.

In 2021, we received 15 applications, of which three applicants, Sona Charles (Indian Institute of Spices Research, India), Anshika Sah (Institute of Home Economics, India) and Rupesh Gelal (Nepal Engineering College, Nepal) were awarded funding across the two open calls.

In addition, in the spirit of the OBF Event Fellowship, we made it easier to attend our own conference with [the BOSC-OBF Event Support Fund](/2021/06/11/bosc-obf-2021-event-support-fund/), which received 9 applications, all of which were granted fee waivers for their participation in BOSC 2021, which took place online as a part of ISMB 2021. These awardees are David Twesigomwe (Sydney Brenner Institute for Molecular Bioscience – South Africa), Gemma Turon (University of Arkansas, USA), Ariel Mundo (University of Arkansas, USA), Paula Roxana Reyes Pérez (UNAM, Mexico), Fortune Ogo-ndah Awala (University of Port Harcourt, Nigeria), Wishah Mohammednour Ahmed Mohammednour (Omdurman Islamic University, Sudan), Menegbe Zibo (Université Félix Houphouët-Boigny, Ivory Coast –NH), Priyanka Sarkar (Deen Dayal Upadhyaya University, India) and Gloria Umutesi (EDAM Ontology Intern, Rwanda).

Here, I have compiled blog posts from a few of these awardees summarising their experience from attending these conferences:

- **Rupesh Gelal:** [My virtual participation at the RISC-V 2021 summit](/2021/12/17/riscv-summit-rgelal-2021)
- **Gemma Turon**: [Highlights of my participation at the BOSC-2021](/2021/08/31/gemma-turon-obf-bosc-2021/)

- **Ariel Mundo Ortiz**: [My participation at BOSC 2021](/2021/09/08/ariel-mundo-ortiz-bosc2021/)
