**Overview of the round 1 of OBF Event Fellowship 2022**

The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) Event Fellowship program](/event-awards/) aims to support and encourage diverse participation at events focusing on open source bioinformatics software development and open science practices in the biological research community. Each year we open two calls for applications, the deadlines for which are 1 April and 1 October.

In 2022 round 1, we received 17 applications, of which six applicants were awarded this fellowship for various events they were participating in. Congratulations **Jemima Becker, Furkan M. Torun, Xi Zhang, Festus Nyasimi, Omar Ahmed, Emmanuel Adamolekun**.

**Confidence Goji Vandu** was also granted their application to attend BOSC 2022, but due to admin oversight, they could not attend the event. The OBF Fellowship Award chairs are discussing how we can redirect this award towards another event the awardee might be able to attend.

Here, we have recently published blog posts from a few awardees summarising their experience from attending these conferences:

- Furkan Torun: [Furkan M. Torun: Highlights of my participation at PyCon IT 2022](/2022/06/17/furkanmtorun-pycon2022/)
- Jemima Becker: [My trip to the EMBO neural stem cells workshop](/2022/06/23/obf-fellow-jemimabecker2022/)
- Festus Nyasimi: [Festus Nyasimi: Journey to the ISMB/BOSC 2022 conference](/2022/08/01/obf-event-fellow2022-fnyasimi/)

Congratulations to each of them!  We are delighted to support their participation with OBF Event Fellowships, and we wish them all the best for their future work.

**Please share this post and apply for the fellowship before 1 October 2022**. Also, read the [updates from the OBF Event Fellowship chairs](/2022/02/07/obf-event-fellowship-update/(opens%20in%20a%20new%20tab)).
