Jeff announces a new release of Biopython:

Biopython 1.23 is now available from the website at:
http://www.biopython.org/

This is mostly a maintenance release, which fixes some problems in the
installation. You do not need to update from 1.22 unless you are using
the Bio.Cluster, Bio.KDTree, or Bio.PDB.mmCIF packages. The changes
made in this release are:
Fixed distribution of files in Bio/Cluster
Now distributing Bio/KDTree/\_KDTree.swig.C
minor updates in installation code
added mmCIF support for PDB files

As usual, please report bugs to biopython-dev@biopython.org, or the bug
database also available from the website.
