The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is run as a two-day meeting before the annual ISMB conference. It is organized by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of open source software development and open science within the biological research community. BOSC offers a focused environment for developers and users to interact and share ideas about standards; software development practices; practical techniques for solving bioinformatics problems; and approaches that promote open science and sharing of data, results and software.

We welcome one-page abstracts on any topic of relevance to open source bioinformatics and open science. Presentation formats are lightning talks, longer talks, and/or posters. We plan to offer a limited number of travel fellowships to help offset expenses for some accepted speakers who would not otherwise be able to attend BOSC – please see the [OBF Travel Fellowship announcement](/2016/03/01/obf-travel-fellowship-program/) for more information.

Session topics include:

- Open Science and Reproducible Research
- Standards and Interoperability
- Data Science
- Visualization
- Translational Bioinformatics
- Bioinformatics Open Source Libraries and Projects
