I installed the new Regulus theme, comments are welcome as to whether or not you like it.

It is possible to customize the color scheme and top-image as well if there are suggestions - perhaps we'll build a header which incorporates our logo once that is [decided](http://bioperl.open-bio.org/wiki/Potential_Logos "_logos").
