To begin something is difficult; to keep something going is a different challenge.
Even when it is the right thing to do, if it does not yield economic benefit in the short term, it may be difficult to sustain.
Open science, including open-source software development and open data, is precisely such an example.
Everyone agrees these are of great importance,
yet when confronted with the immediate demands of an academic career or the short-term profit of a company,
putting in the extra work to make all of the code and data publicly accessible and reusable may not be a priority.
That is why individuals and organizations who not only embrace these principles but persist with them over long periods are worthy of being recognized.
They act not merely for themselves, but for the whole of human society.

The recent news concerning the layoff by the owners BGI of the entire GigaScience editorial team in Hong Kong,
those very people who established the journalâ€™s identity and direction and made it an important journal in biomedical informatics,
has filled us with both surprise and deep disappointment.
Departing Editor in Chief Scott Edmunds wrote a passionate retrospective on his perspective of
[15 years of innovation at GigaScience](https://doi.org/10.59350/hzfr4-z0881) [1].

Since its founding, the GigaScience journal has been at the forefront of data science.
Its initiative to build its own data repository, to assign curators,
and to archive the data underlying accepted articles was truly pioneering, and other journals followed.
Unlike traditional journals operated solely by editorial boards, GigaScience was in effect equivalent to establishing a full-fledged data center.
It was not only about selecting manuscripts,
but also about validating the underlying data and recording the necessary metadata for preservation.
These time-consuming steps might appear to exceed what an ordinary editorial office is supposed to do.
Yet, if we reflect upon the true role of research articles, that of sharing the latest scientific results,
we must admit that it is the conventional journal that has become outdated.
The age of handwritten letters and printed texts has passed; now is the age of computation.
The work that GigaScience did to make sure that not just publications,
but the data they were reporting on, was truly what the scientific community had long needed.

GigaScience was a longtime sponsor of the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC).
Members of its editorial office came to BOSC and the larger Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference it was part of each year,
sometimes giving talks.
Beyond their financial support, and their support and hard work on behalf of open science, the people at GigaScience were our friends.

The decision made by the journal owner to lay off the GigaScience editorial board is not incomprehensible.
In this field it is not unusual for software or databases to fall into disrepair when funding ends or when maintainers move on.
Yet precisely for this reason we have particular respect for  projects that endure for long periods.

We trust that the decision was made after much deliberation, and we sincerely hope that under its new management,
the assets that were so painstakingly constructed will be preserved and further developed for years to come.
And to those talented and brilliant members who were let go, we wish them bright and fortunate opportunities ahead,
and from our hearts we hope that we may once again see them at scientific meetings,
still burning with a passionate commitment to open science and open publication.
