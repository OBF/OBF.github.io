BioJava 5.0.0 was released on the 23rd of March 2018. This represents a major milestone that brings more consolidation and reorganisation of modules. This is the first release to be based on Java 8, bring in your lambdas and stream API calls!

The release represents work done in the last 2 years, alpha releases were available for quite some time and now this makes all the changes officially public.

Some major refactoring occurred in the biojava-structure module. The data model to deal with macromolecular structures has been adapted to be closer to the mmCIF data model. Other improvements in biojava-structure are support for MMTF format and improved symmetry detection code.

See the [full release notes](https://github.com/biojava/biojava/releases/tag/biojava-5.0.0)Â or browse the official [API documentation](http://biojava.org/docs/api/).
