The BOSC Organizing Committee will extend invitations for keynote speakers using the community-nominated list after the comment period closes.
Since the Committee cannot guarantee a speaker's acceptance, they may need to consider individuals not on the original list without repeating the entire nomination process.
However, the Committee remains open to community input if a speaker is believed not to meet the established standards.
