We are pleased to announce the release of Biopython 1.44.

This release includes lots of code improvements and fixes in the Blast interface and parsers, sequence input/output, the SwissProt parser, the clustering routines, as well as a brand new module for population genetics. For reasons of compatibility, some radical changes were necessary in some parts of the code; please let us know if you find some functionality missing.

Source distributions and Windows installers are available from the Biopython website at http://biopython.org. My thanks to all code contributers who made this new release possible.
