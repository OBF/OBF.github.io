title: BOSC 2015 will be in Dublin with ISMB/ECCB 2015

We have asked you, and you have spoken! 59 past and/or future BOSC attendees participated in our survey, answering questions about what they liked at BOSC 2014, what changes they'd like to see, and — most importantly — what they thought about the proposal to possibly hold BOSC 2015 in Norwich (UK) rather than as an ISMB/ECCB SIG in Dublin (Ireland)..

Under this plan, BOSC 2015 would have been shortly before ISMB/ECCB, but in Norwich. We would have been hosted by [The Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC)](http://www.tgac.ac.uk) just after and co-located with the [Galaxy Community Conference 2015](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk) (GCC 2015, hosted by [The Sainsbury Laboratory](http://www.tsl.ac.uk)). Although some survey participants indicated that they would be more likely to attend BOSC 2015 if it were co-located with GCC, the majority preferred BOSC to remain an ISMB SIG, so we will hold BOSC 2015 in Dublin right before ISMB/ECCB 2015.

Here is the summary of responses to the questions about the location of BOSC 2015:

Although the survey is now closed, we are always happy to hear your suggestions for BOSC 2015. (We are particularly interested in increasing diversity at BOSC, and welcome suggestions of people to invite.) You can reach us at [bosc@open-bio.org](mailto:bosc@open-bio.org)
