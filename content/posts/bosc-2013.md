Hello from Berlin, where the pre-BOSC informal [CodeFest 2013](/wiki/Codefest_2013) meeting is already underway. We're looking forward to seeing even more of you on Friday and Saturday for [BOSC 2013](/wiki/BOSC_2013).

BOSC 2013 will be the 14th annual _Bioinformatics Open Source Conference_, and is organised by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF). It is held as a Special Interest Group (SIG) meeting in conjunction with the ISMB conference, which itself is held jointly with the ECCB meeting every second year. This year the [ISMB/ECCB 2013 is in Berlin](http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013), Germany.

You can follow [BOSC on Twitter @OBF\_BOSC](https://twitter.com/OBF_BOSC), and we'll be using the [Twitter Hashtag #BOSC2013](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BOSC2013).

We also have a low-volume [BOSC announcements mailing list](http://lists.open-bio.org/mailman/listinfo/bosc-announce), please sign up if you'd consider attending or submitting a talk or poster for next year - BOSC 2014 and the ISMB 2014 will be in Boston, USA in July 2014.
