The Open Bioinformatics Foundation has been accepted as a mentoring organization for this summer's Google Summer of Code.  Our list of project ideas and mentors is linked from the [O\|B\|F GSoC page](http://open-bio.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code "O|B|F GSoC").

Student applications must be submitted to Google by **April 9, 2010,** see the [official GSoC 2010 FAQ](http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2010/faqs). That is less than three weeks away! 

Students, have a look at that wiki page, contact the project you're interested in working with, and get rolling on that application post-haste.  A good GSoC application takes quite a bit of thought and effort to put together.  **Students are encouraged to get help from mentors to put together a good application.**

Current developers on O\|B\|F projects, have a look through the [GSoC Mentoring Guide](http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCMentoringGuide), and if it looks like something you want to do, there's still time to volunteer as a prospective mentor.  Just add your name to the O\|B\|F and project wiki pages, and contribute your project ideas.  Even if you don't have project ideas of your own, it's good to volunteer.

Google Summer of Code is a Google-sponsored student internship program for open-source projects, open to students from around the world (not just US residents).   Students are paid a $5,000 USD stipend to work as a developer on an open-source project for the summer. For more on GSoC, see the [official GSoC 2010 FAQ](http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2010/faqs).

Thanks to all who helped make OBF's application to GSoC a success, and let's have a great, productive summer of code!
