If you'd like the opportunity to present your work at [BOSC 2019](/events/bosc/) (which will take place in Basel, Switzerland, on July 24-25, the last two days of [ISMB/ECCB 2019](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2019)), now's your chance! The late round of [abstract submission](/events/bosc/submit) is open, and we will be choosing a few abstracts for "Late-Breaking Lightning Talks" as well as posters.

BOSC welcomes submissions about all aspects of open source bioinformatics, open science and open data. More information, and a link to the EasyChair submission portal, can be found at [/events/bosc/submit/](/events/bosc/submit/) .

A few tips to increase your chances of success:
1\. Work discussed in BOSC presentations must be open source, with a recognized open source license and a URL for accessing your code. Submissions that don't meet those requirements will be rejected.
2\. We look for impact in building or sustaining open source communities. It's ok if your project is just getting started--tell us about how it will help the community, and how others will be able to contribute to it in the future.
3\. If you submitted an abstract in the first round and didn't get selected for a talk, you can revise your abstract and make a new submission in the late round. (You can't just update your previous submission--you must start a new one in order to be considered for the late round.)
4\. All submissions must include a 200-word summary. A one- or two-page PDF is also encouraged, though not required for poster-only submissions. We hope you'll use the extra space to tell us more about your project and how it fits into the bioinformatics open source ecosystem, and maybe add some cool pictures, too!

Note that the deadline for submissions is Thursday, May 15, at 23:59 in the ["Anywhere on Earth" time zone](https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth), which is UTC-12. That means that for almost everyone, the deadline is effectively the morning of May 16.

Please spread the word about BOSC--we welcome everyone, and are actively seeking to increase the diversity of our participants.
