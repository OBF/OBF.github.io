[The 2020 Bioinformatics Community Conference (BCC2020)](https://bcc2020.github.io/), which brings together the BOSC and Galaxy communities, will take place online--more info [here](https://bcc2020.github.io/blog/going-virtual).

The online meeting will still be held July 18-21. Registration will open in a few weeks, and fees will be lower than for an in-person meeting. [Abstract submission](/events/bosc/submit/) will open soon and will close April 30th. We will follow the usual submission and review processes.

We are discussing how to arrange the schedule to allow for participation across the globe. We welcome your input on how to make our first Virtual Bioinformatics Community Conference a success.
