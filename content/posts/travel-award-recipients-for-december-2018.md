We had a great round of OBF travel fellowship candidates in our last round of applications, and after review we extended offers to three deserving applicants: Malvika Sharan, Lindsay Rutter, and Sarker Kamruzzaman. They’ve all accepted the award, and we’re looking forward to hearing about their experiences!

Congratulations to our December 2018 recipients:

**Malvika Sharan** will be attending [BOSC](/wiki/BOSC_2019) at [ISMB 2019](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2019) in Basel this July. Abstract submissions have only just opened, but she intends to submit an abstract expanding on the idea “Inclusiveness in Open Science” that she spoke about last year ( [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/malvikasharan/inclusiveness-in-open-science)). She’s been active in the BOSC community for several years, participating in abstract review and BoF organisation, and she plans to continue this for 2019.

**Lindsay Rutter** attended the [Plant and Animal Genome Conference](http://www.intlpag.org/2019/) to give an invited workshop talk for the “ _Big Data: Manage your data before your data kills you_” session. Her software " [bigPint](https://lindsayrutter.github.io/bigPint/)" allows biologists to visualize genomics data, especially RNA-sequencing data, and was recently submitted and accepted to [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/bigPint.html).

**Sarker Kamruzzaman** will be attending the [2019 U.S. Semantic Technologies Symposium](http://www.us2ts.org/) in March. He’ll be presenting a tutorial " [On the Role of Data Semantics for Explainable AI](http://us2ts.org/2019/posts/program-session-iii.html)" as well as a poster. The conference is meant to bring together specialists in many different fields, including natural sciences, so they can benefit from emerging semantic web technologies.

Watch this space for blog posts from each of the awardees.

The next deadline for travel awards is April 15, 2019. You can apply to travel to participate at any event that develops or promotes open source development and open science in the biological research community. The program is aimed at increasing diverse participation at such events. See the [OBF travel award](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/master/Travel_fellowships.md) page for details and how to apply.
