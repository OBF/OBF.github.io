title: Apply for OBF Membership online

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) is pleased to announce that we’ve finally entered the 21st century and upgraded our membership form from paper (yep!) to an [online form](https://goo.gl/l6WJ23 "OBF membership form").

[Membership in the OBF](/wiki/Membership) is free, and is open to anyone who has attended BOSC or can otherwise demonstrate commitment to [OBF's goals](/wiki/Main_Page#About_Us). The information you enter on the form, including your email address, will be treated confidentially - we are in the business of promoting open source and open science, not in selling email addresses.

If you have any questions about OBF or OBF membership, you can contact us at board@open-bio.org and/or tweet to [@OBF\_News](https://twitter.com/obf_news).
