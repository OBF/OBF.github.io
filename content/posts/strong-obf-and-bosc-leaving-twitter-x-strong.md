title: <strong>OBF and BOSC leaving Twitter/X</strong>
url: /2023/11/20/leaving-x/

---
As of November 21, 2023, the Open Bioinformatics Foundation and BOSC will no longer post on Twitter/X. Although in the past it was a useful social medium, it is no longer compatible with our values, as expressed in the [OBF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/master/code-of-conduct/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md):

```
We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, sharing and contributing. All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.
```

Currently, we are not planning to delete our X/Twitter accounts (@OBF\_NEWS and @OBF\_BOSC); we will leave them as archives.

Even before recent events prompted our final departure, we were already transitioning off of X in favor of other social media. You can find us at:
