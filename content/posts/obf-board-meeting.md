The OBF board meeting will be held via conference call on Nov 19, from 12:30PM to 2PM PST. Â Agenda items and information about participating is available on the [agenda webpage](http://open-bio.org/wiki/Minutes:2008_ConfCall). We anticipate this call primarily to manage administrative tasks for the foundation. We welcome input on including more members in the OBF leadership and helping set the direction for the foundation.
