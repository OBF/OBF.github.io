The OBF Community Support Sponsorship scheme aims to sponsor small open-source-focused events like a scientific meeting, small conference, training workshop, hackathon, or time-limited series like monthly seminars. See [details in this post](/2021/05/11/obf-community-support-sponsorship/). One application was funded under this program to prototype the workflow, with OBF offering financial support for a [seminar series hosted by the Bioinformatics Hub Kenya](https://bhki.org/2022/08/17/empowering-our-community-with-bioinformatics-data-management-and-soft-skills/). Congratulations to Michael Kofia Landi for leading this application and working collaboratively with the BHKi team – Pauline Karega, David Kiragu, Margaret Wanjiku and Festus Nyasimi – and OBF Board including Treasurer Heather Wiencko, to help establish a process for this new type of OBF funding.
