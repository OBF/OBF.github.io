Great news: Google announced today that the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) has been accepted as a mentoring organization for this summer's Google Summer of Code!

GSoC is a Google-sponsored student internship program for open-source projects, open to students from around the world (not just US residents). Students are paid a $5000 USD stipend to work as a developer on an open-source project for the summer. For more on GSoC, see [GSoC 2011 FAQ](http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/faqs).

Student applications are due April 8, 2011 at 19:00 UTC. Students who are interested in participating should look at the [OBF's GSoC page](http://open-bio.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code), which lists project ideas, and whom to contact about applying.

For current developers on OBF projects, please consider volunteering to be a mentor if you have not already, and contribute project ideas. Just list your name and project ideas on the [OBF wiki page](http://open-bio.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code), and on the relevant project's GSoC wiki page.

Thanks to all who helped make OBF's application to GSoC a success, and let's have a great, productive summer of code!
