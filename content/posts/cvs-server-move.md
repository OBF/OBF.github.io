The CVS repository is migrating from 'pub' to a new host called 'dev' and requires us to re-issue accounts. This will be a good opportunity to verify email addresses and remove unused accounts.

You should have received an email from Chris D requesting specific information and you will get a new password in the response. If not you will need to send a note to the helpdesk at support\_AT\_open-bio.org. The changover will happen around March 25th.
