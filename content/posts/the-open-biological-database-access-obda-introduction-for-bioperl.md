Do you need to access sequences from multiple places? Would you like
to easily retrieve your own local sequences from indexed flat files,
all other sequences on species X from department wide raletional
database and the rest from global internet servers?

The Open Biological Database Access (OBDA) System was designed so that
one could use the same application code to access data from all three
of the database types by simply changing a few lines in a
"configuration file". This makes application code more portable and
easier to maintain.

This document gives an overview and shows how to use it in BioPerl:

http://www.bioperl.org/HOWTOs/pdf/OBDA\_Access.pdf

OBDA System is also implemented in BioJava, BioPython and BioRuby.
