Google announced today that the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)](http://open-bio.org/) has been accepted as a mentoring organization for [Google Summer of Code 2012](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012)!

[![GSoC 2012 Logo](http://code.google.com/images/GSoC2012_300x200.png)](http://code.google.com/soc/)[Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](http://code.google.com/soc/) is a Google-sponsored student internship program for open-source projects, open to students from around the world (not just US residents). Students are paid a $5000 USD stipend to work as a developer on an open-source project for the summer. For more on GSoC, see the [GSoC 2012 FAQ](http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2012/faqs).

Student applications are due April 6, 2012 at 19:00 UTC. Students who are interested in participating should look at the [OBF's GSoC page](http://open-bio.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code), which lists project ideas, and whom to contact about applying.

For current developers on OBF projects, please consider volunteering to be a mentor if you have not already, and contribute project ideas. Just list your name and project ideas on OBF wiki and on the relevant project's GSoC wiki page.

Thanks to all who helped make OBF's application to GSoC a success, and let's have a great, productive summer of code!
