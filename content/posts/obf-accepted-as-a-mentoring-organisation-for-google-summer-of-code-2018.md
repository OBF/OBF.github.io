The Open Bioinformatics Foundation has been accepted as a [mentoring organisation](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5340733272227840/) for the [2018 instance of the Google Summer of Code](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/02/gsoc-2018-organizations.html). OBF is acting as an umbrella for ten bioinformatics Open Source projects, making it possible to offer a [very diverse set of student projects](http://obf.github.io/GSoC/ideas/).

Are you a student and interested in applying for any of the projects? The student application period is open from March 12th through 27th from the [official GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). See the full [timeline](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline) for details. Feel free to contact the mentors of projects you are interested in already, though.
