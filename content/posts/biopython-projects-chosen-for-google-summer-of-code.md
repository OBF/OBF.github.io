Congratulations to Nick Matzke and Eric Talevich who have had [Biopython](http://www.biopython.org) projects accepted for this year's [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/). Both projects were accepted as part of [The National Evolutionary Synthesis Center's (NESCent)](http://www.nescent.org/index.php) involvement as a mentoring organisation with the program.

Nick will spend his summer working on modules that access locality data from biodiversity databases and incorporate this information in biogeographical and phylogenetic analyses ( [Nick's abstract](http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/nescent/t124022798250)) while Eric will be building a parser for the emerging PhyloXML format for storing and sharing phylogenetic trees ( [Eric's abstract](http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/nescent/t124022798969)).

Congratulations to Nick and Eric and to their mentors Stephen Smith and Brad Chapman (who has [his own post on this topic](http://bcbio.wordpress.com/2009/04/20/biopython-projects-for-google- summer-of-code/)) and thanks to Google and NESCent for their support of these projects.
