Thanks to funding from our [sponsors](/events/bosc-2021/sponsors/), we are opening a special call for applications to the [BOSC-OBF Event Support Fund](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefSJg9n99uZUPLxsvbm1PkV1NlH36CYFniCRxdgreefIuPgg/viewform). This fund aims to increase participation of members from groups otherwise underrepresented in BOSC or in bioinformatics community events in general, including but not limited to underrepresented demographic groups (country of residence and citizenship), ethnic background (historically underrepresented and other minority groups), career stages, gender identity and expression, people with disabilities and members from low income/resource organisations.

A limited number of qualified applicants will be chosen to receive **free registration for ISMB/ECCB 2021**. No other financial support (for example, for internet access or headphones) will be included.

The **application** **deadline is 30 June 2021**, and decisions will be sent out by 8 July 2021. Apply at [https://forms.gle/aDVSHpq7Gs46CNDb6](https://forms.gle/aDVSHpq7Gs46CNDb6).

We hope youâ€™ll join us at BOSC! For more #BOSC2021 news, [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/OBF_BOSC)!
