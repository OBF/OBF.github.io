We are currently planning a timetable for the next few Bioperl releases, including the next developer release (v1.5.2), the next stable release (1.6) and beyond. Users are welcome to add requests (within reason!), donate code, etc. Lots of changes in store!

The release schedule can be found [here](http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Bioperl_Release). In order to add comments, you will be required to sign up for an account on the [BioPerl wiki](http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Main_Page).
