Release Pumpkin [Chris Fields](http://bioperl.org/wiki/User:Cjfields) has announced the [release of BioPerl 1.6](http://bioperl.org/wiki/Getting_BioPerl#BioPerl_Releases) \- the first stable release in a several years containing many significant improvements and bug fixes.

> I am proud to announce, on behalf of the BioPerl core developers, that BioPerl 1.6.0 is now available.  This is the first BioPerl core release in the 1.6 series and is considered a 'stable' (non-developer) release.  The distribution has been uploaded to CPAN and is available under author name CJFIELDS; it should be hitting the various CPAN nodes over the next 24 hours.  A direct CPAN link is here:
