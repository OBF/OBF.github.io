The [OBF Travel Fellowship](/travel-awards/) program, established in 2016, aims to increase diverse participation at events related to open source bioinformatics. Applications are reviewed three times a year. Applicants may apply for attending any event that develops or promotes open source development and open science in the biological research community. It doesnâ€™t have to be an OBF-related event, and it can be one that you already attended in the recent past. For example, if you attended BOSC 2019 and your travel expenses were not covered by your employer or university, you could apply for a travel fellowship to help defray those expenses (up to a maximum of $1000, in most cases). Travel fellowship awardees are required to write a blog post about their experience attending the event; you can see some past such posts on our [blog](/tag/travel-fellowship/).

The next application deadline is August 15, 2019. We encourage you to apply if you are attending an event that promotes open source bioinformatics software development or open science, and your participation will contribute to diversity in the wider community.
