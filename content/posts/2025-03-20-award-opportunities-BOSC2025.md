We recognize that the high price of travel and registration can make it hard for some people to attend BOSC/ISMB. Below are some ways to apply for financial assistance to present your work at BOSC 2025.

## OBF Event Fellowships

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)'s
[Event Fellowships](/event-awards/) are aimed at increasing diverse participation at events promoting open science in the bioinformatics and biological research communities.

Awards are made three times a year; the next **deadline is April 1, 2025** (note that this is earlier than the ISMB/ECCB submission deadline of April 17).

## BOSC registration fee waiver

{{< columns >}}

Authors who [submit their work to BOSC](/events/bosc-2025/submit/) can request ISMB registration fee support on the abstract submission form (these requests are not seen by reviewers). This initiative is funded by [sponsorships](/events/sponsors/).

Only presenting authors whose abstracts are accepted for talk or poster presentation are eligible for this fee waiver, and depending on the number of applicants, not all requests will be granted.

{{< endcolumns >}}

Requests from early-career applicants and people from underrepresented geographical areas will be given priority. 
Applicants will be notified about whether their fee waiver request was granted around the same time that abstract acceptance notifications go out (May 14).
