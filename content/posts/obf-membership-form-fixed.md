title: OBF membership form fixed

We recently discovered that the application to join the OBF (linked from the [OBF membership page](/wiki/Membership)) was not working. It broke some time after August 31. We have now replaced it and it is working once again.

If you applied for OBF membership between September 1 and yesterday, please go to the new form (https://goo.gl/x9KYWL) and resubmit your application. We apologize for the inconvenience!
