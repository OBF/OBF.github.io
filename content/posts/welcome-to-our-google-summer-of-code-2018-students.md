The Open Bioinformatics Foundation is again participating in the Google Summer of Code program this year. Last Monday the selected students were announced. Congratulations to all of you, and a heartfelt welcome. I also want to use this opportunity to thank all students who applied. Resources were limited, we did not get all the slots that we asked for, and so we had to make some tough choices.  We wish you all the best for your future endeavours, and hope to be able to work with you in future. The field of bioinformatics is a small one, as you will find out.

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation will host [six student projects](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5340733272227840/#projects) this year:

- Hitesh Joshi will be working on a Bionode workflow engine for streamed data analysis
- Synchon Mandal will be improving the constraint-based modeling in COBRApy
- Sophia Mersmann will improve the posterior error probability estimation for OpenMS peptide search engine results
- Edgar Garriga Nogales will implement support for Research Object specification into the Nextflow framework
- Sarthak Sehgal will be rewriting the front-end code powering the BioJS websites
- Megh Thakkar will be revamping the back-end of the BioJS websites

Please join me in welcoming all of them to the Open  Bioinformatics community and the respective subprojects. I'm sure we'll have a great, productive summer together.

PS: We ask all our students to blog about their summer of code experience and will be updating this post with links to their respective blogs.
