I've started migrating content to the [Wiki Site](/wiki). I am hoping this will work out well. We need a couple of things.

1. Decide on a theme for this site, customize it to make it a Bioperl style. Consider having a unifying style across all the [O\|B\|F](http://www.open-bio.org) sites as Chris started doing with the foundation site.

1. Generate a project image (or several that can be rotated) for the header on the site, something with a camel and DNA and images of phylogenetic trees and BLAST searches would be cool.
1. Generate a bioperl logo. I've started playing with a few things, I'll upload ideas next week.
1. Migrate static content ( [DIST](http://bioperl.org/DIST)) and content that is synced from CVS ( [SRC](http://bioperl.org/SRC), [HOWTOs](http://bioperl.org/HOWTOs)) over here. Also some of the [Core Documentation](http://bioperl.org/Core/Latest/modules.html) pages are pod2html ified and I think we need to figure out how to keep them up to date.

I imagine that [this site](http://bioperl.open-bio.org) would be a place to post announcements, blog current code updates, and provide a simple clean interface to Bioperl information. The [Wiki site](wiki) will provide more community documentation and a way to keep tutorials and installation help up-to-date.

I'm going to start a wiki list of these things that need to be done so we can coordinate our efforts and get ideas from the community.

There was a request for a forum-like software, something like [Genetic Software Forum](http://www.rannala.org/gsf/) that has been setup. But this would duplicate some of the [email list](http://bioperl.org/mailman/listinfo/bioperl-l) traffic and I am not sure that we can get developers to both read email and post to the website forum. We are stick in the mud about some things I suspect.
