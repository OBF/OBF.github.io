Arun Decano is a PhD research fellow in the Infection Genomics Group at Dublin City University in Dublin, Ireland. Her research, with advisor [Dr. Tim Downing](https://www.dcu.ie/biotechnology/people/tim-downing.shtml), focuses on the phylogenomic study of a multidrug-resistant bacterial population and aims to develop novel infection control strategies using whole genome sequence data.

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation awarded Ms. Decano a [travel fellowship](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/master/Travel_fellowships.md) to help defray the cost of attending the European Galaxy Administrator Workshop ( [https://www.elixir-europe.org/events/european-galaxy-administrator-workshop](https://www.elixir-europe.org/events/european-galaxy-administrator-workshop)) in January 2018.

The [OBF travel fellowship](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/master/Travel_fellowships.md) program was launched in 2016 to help increase diverse participation at events promoting open source bioinformatics software development and open science in the biological research community. The next application deadline will be April 15, 2018—see [https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/master/Travel\_fellowships.md](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/master/Travel_fellowships.md) for information and to apply.
