_The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) Event Fellowship program](/travel-awards) aims to promote diverse participation at events promoting open source bioinformatics software development and open science practices in the biological research community. Festus Nyasimi, A co-founder and lead of the [Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya Initiative (BHKi)](https://www.bhki.org), attended the [ISMB/BOSC conference 2022](/events/bosc-2022/), supported by this fellowship granted to him in the first round of 2022._

In mid-May, I attended a different conference where I shared my experience with community building in the bioinformatics space with one of the attendees. I had a chance to brief them about the BHKI community we are building and growing in Africa. Immediately they suggested I should check out the ISMB/BOSC conference happening on July 11th - 14th, 2022.

I looked into it immediately, and I was lucky to find the late abstract submission round was still on. I sent in an abstract on our community, its activities, and the progress we have made in the region. A few weeks later, our abstract was strongly accepted for poster presentation and iced up with free registration. Bam!!! This felt like a Lebron James slam dunk or Steph Curry swish three point shot. Never felt this happy to go share our work with a larger bioinformatics community.

In the happy moment, the rush to plan for the conference set in; this included travel, accommodation and misc stuff. The rest of the team and I worked on the presentation alongside our training activities; this is one amazing team. Considering we are a young and growing community mostly running training through volunteering and small grants to cater for the training, we had to find a source of funding to cater for the conference fee and that’s where the OBF Event fellowship showed up perfectly. Honestly, I least expected this but I didn’t discount myself and gave it a shot; I always tell myself, _“ **if I don’t knock, I will never know the answer**”._

Fast forward, here I am at the conference; I got to attend some sessions i.e. BioInfo Core, NetBio, Varl, MLCSB and Educational COSI, where I learnt many new skills in Bioinformatics the BOSC track started. Some of the things I learned I will propose to the organizing team we develop tutorials for the community to learn from. The opening day of BOSC was the peak of the conference for me; I had an opportunity to learn more about open-source software, how to efficiently contribute to ongoing projects and how to help communities grow. I also had a chance to join the GA4GH VRS hackathon at the conference. I had a good opportunity to represent the BHKI community on what we are doing and received great responses from attendees who visited my poster. The light was shining on our community; I hope the spotlight will be on and attract more collaborators to help us achieve our mission of a collaborative and inclusive hub.

Some of the cool people I meet at BOSC: _panelist Jenea Adams and keynote speaker Jason Williams_.  

I learned how to advocate for our community to grow well towards achieving Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) goals; these are necessary for a strong, welcoming and collaborative community. Interacting with attendees at the conference provided me with an opportunity to learn more about leadership and how to be a good leader from a different perspective. I look forward to keeping in touch with other communities to grow further collaborations, especially in community empowerment.

Generally, the whole conference turned out to be the best one I have attended in many months through the pandemic, and I am so thankful to OBF, all organisations and team members who made it possible for me to attend the conference. Looking forward to more of these sweet moments.
