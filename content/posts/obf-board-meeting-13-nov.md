The Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) will be holding a public [Board of Directors](/wiki/Board) meeting on Tuesday, 13 Nov, 2012, at 11.30am EST (8.30am PST, 17:30 CET, 16:30 UTC/GMT).

The meeting will be held online or over conference call. We will post details about how to dial in or connect closer to the date ( [here](/wiki/Minutes:2012_Nov_ConfCall)).

On the agenda Richard Holland and Chris Fields are running for election to the Board, and some other items primarily up for discussion, including how to keep our membership roll up-to-date and increasing with the least barriers. We will post a more detailed agenda in advance of the meeting ( [here](/wiki/Minutes:2012_Nov_ConfCall)).

OBF members should have already received notice of this meeting via the [OBF memberâ€™s mailing list](http://lists.open-bio.org/mailman/listinfo/members).
