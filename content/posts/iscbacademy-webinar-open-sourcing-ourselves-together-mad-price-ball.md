### Open Sourcing Ourselves - Together

Mad Price Ball (Open Humans Foundation)

September 14, 2021 at 15:00 UTC / 11:00AM EDT

ABSTRACT: "Open source" refers to the practice of making software freely available, re-usable, and adaptable. We might also ask: how can we apply "open source" to understanding ourselves as humans -- our genomes, health, or behavior? While navigating concerns about privacy and consent, the principles of "open" should also prompt us to consider what we can do to enable others. How can we make it more "open" for people to research themselves? Open source communities have come to understand that it takes more than just sharing code: it requires building a community. These same principles also apply to individual and collective research about our health. Drawing on my work with the Personal Genome Project and Open Humans, I share insights and lessons I've learned in efforts to collect, share, and analyze our personal data to better understand ourselves.
