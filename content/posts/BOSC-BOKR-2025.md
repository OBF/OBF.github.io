We are pleased to announce that BOSC and the newly-renamed
[Bio-Ontologies and Knowledge Representation (BOKR)](https://www.bio-ontologies.org.uk/2025-meeting) will join forces for a day at ISMB/ECCB 2025! The joint session will include talks chosen from abstracts submitted to BOSC or Bio-Ontologies, plus a keynote speaker who is well known in both the ontology and open science communities (stay tuned for an announcement soon!).

BOSC and BOKR are two of the longest-running COSIs (Communities of Special Interest) at ISMB: BOSC started in 2000 and BOKR (then called Bio-Ontologies) in 1998. Bio-Ontologies focuses on the FAIR development and application of ontologies and other Linked Open Data resources and the organization, presentation and dissemination of knowledge in biomedicine and the life sciences. BOSC covers the full spectrum of open source, open science, open data and open standards in the life sciences.

You can submit relevant abstracts to either BOSC or BOKR (please do not double-submit the same abstract); the Program Chairs of both COSIs will consider appropriate abstracts for the joint session.

BOSC 2025 will take place July 21-22, and BOKR will be July 22-23. The joint session will be part or all of the day on July 22.
