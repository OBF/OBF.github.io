title: OBF Redmine server now available

The OBF now has a sparkly new [Redmine instance](http://redmine.open-bio.org) running on Amazon EC2, thanks to efforts from Chris Dagdigian and Jason Stajich (with some admin help from yours truly).  Bugs and user names (along with email contacts) from our old [Bugzilla](http://bugzilla.open-bio.org) v2 server have been migrated over, though some links need to be [fixed](http://redmine.open-bio.org/issues/3183).

[Redmine](http://www.redmine.org) is a project management web application that has [several nice features](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Features) over other systems, including issue tracking, multiple project management, wikis, forums, and calendaring.

Previous Bugzilla users will need to either [reset their password](http://redmine.open-bio.org/account/lost_password) using their original Bugzilla login (an email address) or contact the OBF Helpdesk to get their password.
