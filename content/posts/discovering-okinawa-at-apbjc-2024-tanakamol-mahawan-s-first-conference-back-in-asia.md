_The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) Event Fellowship program](/travel-awards) aims to promote diverse participation at events promoting open-source bioinformatics software development and open science practices in the biological research community. Tanakamol Mahawan, a PhD student at the Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology , University of Liverpool, was awarded an OBF Event Fellowship to attend [Asia & Pacific Bioinformatics Joint Congress 2024](https://www.apbjc.asia/)_.

This year’s Asia & Paciﬁc Bioinformatics Joint Conference (APBJC 2024) in Okinawa was a special milestone for me; it was the first conference I attended since moving back to Thailand from the UK. Now a new lecturer at a Thai university, I felt a unique excitement and gratitude stepping into this event, thrilled by the chance to reconnect with the vibrant bioinformatics community in Asia Pacific and meet others passionate about advancing open science.

#### **Falling in Love with Okinawa**

From the moment I landed at Naha Airport, I was charmed by Okinawa. The warm weather was a welcome reminder of home, and as I walked toward my hotel, I found myself surrounded by the sights and sounds of the Okinawa Traditional Eisa Festival, a lively celebration filled with rhythmic drumming and dance. The island’s beauty was undeniable—pristine beaches, lush landscapes, and a culture that exudes warmth. Walking through the streets, I saw the incredible fusion of Okinawan tradition and modernity, from the traditional shisa lion statues guarding doorways to bustling markets selling both local delicacies and modern treats. Okinawa instantly felt like the perfect setting for an international gathering focused on innovation and collaboration.

**The Science of Batch Effect Correction**

At the conference, I had the opportunity to present my research, “A Comprehensive Approach to Batch Effect Correction in Machine Learning: A Case Study Using Pancreatic Cancer RNA-Seq Data.” This was a moment I had been working toward, sharing insights from my PhD on tackling one of the core challenges in omics data analysis. I highlighted the importance of open science principles—transparency, reproducibility, and community collaboration—all of which are essential in bioinformatics.

It was encouraging to see a strong interest in my poster, with attendees eager to discuss the nuances of batch effect correction. We discussed  why quality checks are crucial before using any batch-corrected data in downstream analyses—a topic that resonated with many who had experienced the complexities of multi-source data integration firsthand. As part of my commitment to open science, I shared the link to my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Victormah/ML_PDACBiomarker), where others can access the code and workflow I developed for batch correction. This, I believe, contributes to a collective effort in making bioinformatics research reproducible and accessible to all.

#### **Building Quality Connections**

One of the most enriching parts of the conference was meeting new friends and potential collaborators. A memorable group of PhD students from Osaka, Hokkaido and Oxford brought fresh perspectives and infectious enthusiasm, making our post-conference discussions both lively and enlightening. We shared experiences and stories over local food, discussing everything from research challenges to future aspirations.

Another exciting connection was Dr. Nok, a researcher from Singapore and a senior in machine learning research. We bonded over our shared interests and began brainstorming ideas for a potential collaborative project. Meeting these brilliant minds underscored how bioinformatics is more than just science—it connects researchers across borders, allowing us to work together towards common goals.

#### **Embracing Open Science and Representing Thailand**

My participation in APBJC 2024 was more than just a chance to present my work; it was an opportunity to promote open-source bioinformatics and open science, fields where transparency and accessibility are essential. My research, part of which has been published in BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Science, is available on GitHub, where I’ve shared tutorials and workflows aimed at making complex analyses more accessible. This commitment to open science is something I hold close, as it embodies the collaborative spirit that drives meaningful progress in bioinformatics.

Attending APBJC 2024 also held a personal significance for me. As a Thai researcher in the relatively underrepresented field of bioinformatics in my region, I am passionate about bringing a unique perspective from Thailand to the global stage. This conference allowed me to represent Thailand, contributing to diversity in the open science community while fostering interdisciplinary connections.

In the end, APBJC 2024 was much more than a scientific gathering—it was an inspiring experience highlighting bioinformatics's collaborative essence. I left Okinawa with a renewed sense of purpose, new friendships, and the excitement of upcoming projects. I look forward to continuing this journey and, hopefully, inspiring the next generation of scientists from Thailand and beyond. Thank you APBJC 2024, for arranging the wonderful event and OBF Event Fellowship for giving me this great opportunity.
