[![](/w/images/b/b0/Pear.png)](/wiki/BOSC_2014) To encourage more student presentations at the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC), this year we're waiving the registration fee for accepted student presenters. When you submit your abstract ( [BOSC abstract call open until 4th April](http://news.open-bio.org/news/2014/03/bosc-2014-call-for-abstracts/)), you must tick the student box:

_Student submissions must have a full-time student as the first named and presenting author, and be mostly written by students._

Please note that because BOSC registration is via the ISCB as [one of the ISCM SIG meetings](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2014-program/ismb2014-sigs-satellite-meetings#bosc), eligible students must contact us **_before_** filling in their ISCB registration to ensure the BOSC SIG fee is waived.

Furthermore, as in previous years, BOSC Student Travel Awards sponsored by [Eagle Genomics](http://www.eaglegenomics.com/) will be awarded to the top student presentations to help with your travel and accommodation costs.

**Update (2 May 2014):** We've just sent out the accepted talk invitations, and are offering a registration fee waiver to four student speakers.
