The Open Bioinformatics Foundation was shocked and saddened to learn that our colleague and collaborator [James Taylor, a professor of biology and computer science at Johns Hopkins University, died on April 2, 2020](https://bio.jhu.edu/2020/04/03/in-memoriam-professor-james-taylor/). James was one of the creators and PIs of the Galaxy Project, which is among the most widely used platforms in open bioinformatics. The Galaxy community has created a [tribute page](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2020-04-james-taylor/) for James.

We have close ties to James and the Galaxy project via our flagship conference. [BOSC](/events/bosc/), which was first held in partnership with the Galaxy Community Conference (GCC) in 2018, will again be co-hosted with GCC at the online Bioinformatics Community Conference (BCC2020) this July.

OBF joins many others in mourning the loss of a pillar of the bioinformatics community.
