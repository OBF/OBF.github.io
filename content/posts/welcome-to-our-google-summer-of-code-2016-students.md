title: Welcome to our Google Summer of Code 2016 students
url: /2016/04/25/welcome-gsoc-2016-students/

---
The Open Bioinformatics Foundation is participating in the Google Summer of Code 2016 program, and last Friday the selected students were announced. Congratulations to all of you, and welcome. I also want to use this opportunity to thank all students who applied. Resources are limited and your proposals did not make it easy to select our finalists. We wish you all the best for your future endeavours, and hope to be able to work with you in future. The field of bioinformatics is a small one after all.

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation gets to host [eight student projects this](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5693436329984000/#projects) year:

- [Alisha Mechtley](https://github.com/AlishaMechtley/treematcher/wiki/Blog) will work with the ETE toolkit on tree searching using regular-expression-like queries.
- [Anton Khodak](https://anton-khodak.github.io/argparse2cwl-blog/2016/08/11/gentle-introduction.html) will work on the Common Workflow Language, creating an automated tool wrapper/converter for CWL.
- [Christian Fischer](https://chfi.se/posts/2016-08-22-gsoc-final.html) will work on the GeneNetwork Genome Browser.
- [Graham Dyer](https://sxibolet.2pitau.org/gsoc.html) will work on openSNP, extending the quantified-self support.
- [Julian Mazzitelli](https://github.com/bionode/gsoc16/blob/8a155a14c34d820a3a77d15b3600d4adf225f179/README.md) will work on a workflow engine for streamed data analysis in Bionode.
- [Mariana Nave](https://bitbucket.org/mnave/gsoc-blog/) will improve the prediction for RiPP clusters in antiSMASH.
- [Mateus Jabor](http://mateusjabour.github.io/gsoc-code-submission) will work on improving the user experience in openSNP.
- [Vivek Rai](http://raivivek.in/programming/gsoc-16-wrap-up.html#main) will work on linking phenotypes to SNPs in openSNP.

Please join me in welcoming all of them in the Open Bioinformatics Foundation community and the respective subprojects. It looks like this will be a great summer.
