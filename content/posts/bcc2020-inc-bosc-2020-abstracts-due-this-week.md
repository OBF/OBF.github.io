We look forward to receiving lots of abstracts by the end of this week from people interested in presenting at the online [Bioinformatics Community Conference (BCC2020)](https://bcc2020.github.io/), which combines the Galaxy Community Conference, and our own Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC). The [BCC2020 abstract submission](https://bcc2020.github.io/submit/) deadline is Friday 8 May 2020.

Some of the recent round of the [OBF Travel Fellowships](/travel-awards/) will be supporting BCC2020 attendees with video conferencing costs (headsets, web-cameras, etc), full announcement coming soon.
