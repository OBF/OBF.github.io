I've added a page about [RSS feeds](/wiki/BioPerl:RSS_feeds) in BioPerl. These include links to CVS commits as a RSS feed. This a bit of a hack using cvs2rss and cvs2cl and I have hardcoded it to show the last 30 commits only.

In addition RSS news is now embedded on the [main BioPerl](/) and [Tracking CVS commits](/wiki/Tracking_CVS_commits) webpages to make for better interlinking between the news and wiki site ( _you might even be reading this there_).
