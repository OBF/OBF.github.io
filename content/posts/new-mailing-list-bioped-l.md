A new mailing list has been created for discussion of software system for genotypes, pedigrees, and linkage data at [/mailman/listinfo/bioped-l](/mailman/listinfo/bioped-l)

This is intended to build off the initial work done in Perl for bioperl-pedigree but is applicable to all who want to contribute to the design or implementation in any language. Database persistence and pedigree rendering are initial areas that will be addressed.
