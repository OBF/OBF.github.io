Open Bio is officially a [mentoring organization](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2014/obf) for Google Summer of Code 2014!
See [Google's official announcement](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2014/02/mentoring-organizations-for-google.html) for more details on what this means in general.

What's next? [Google's GSoC timeline](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014) lays out what we need to do as a mentoring organization during the coming weeks. Students can apply March 10--21 through the [official GSoC 2014 website](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014) to work with OBF. Up to that point, we'll be reaching out to potential students and mentors, and contining to develop [potential project ideas](/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2014_Ideas). If you'd like to get involved, introduce yourself on our [Google Plus community](https://plus.google.com/communities/103096212020630764091) or on the mailing lists.
