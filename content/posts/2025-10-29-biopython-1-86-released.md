Biopython 1.86 has been released and is available from our [website](https://biopython.org/wiki/Download) and [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/biopython/1.86).

This contains about nine months worth of updates, and is our first release with Python 3.14 support.
See [change-log in the news file](https://github.com/biopython/biopython/blob/biopython-186/NEWS.rst)
(most of the changes are in `Bio.Align` and `Bio.PDB`).
There have also been a few [deprecations and removals of older code](https://github.com/biopython/biopython/blob/biopython-186/DEPRECATED.rst).

Many thanks to the Biopython developers and community for making this release possible, especially the following contributors who were happy to be named:

- Rachel Stern (first contribution)
- Fabio Zanini
- Michiel de Hoon
- Oliver Wissett (first contribution)
- Peter Cock
- Samuel Prince (first contribution)
- Cassie Bastress (first contribution)
