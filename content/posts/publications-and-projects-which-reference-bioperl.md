I've been updating the [Publications page](http://bioperl.open-bio.org/wiki/BioPerl_publications "pubs") on the wiki to keep track of the number of pubs and projects which use BioPerl. [Google scholar](http://scholar.google.com) seems to get a lot of these correct, sometimes there are redundancies, but generally has been a good place to find this list. The other way is to go to each of the journal's home pages, and search for "BioPerl" in the content, that can be tedious though....
