Brad is working on an update of the Biopython website and is so obsessed with it that he is working on it during his minimal lunch time in which he should be enjoying the nice friendly sunshine of a Georgia friday.

This is really not exciting news, but I need some Biopython news to test the news gathering capabilities of the main Biopython page. More info once I actually get something accomplished.
