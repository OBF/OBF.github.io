Congratulations to our accepted students!

Thanks very much to all the students who applied, we very much appreciate your hard work.

We are now in the GSoC Community Bonding Period. Official work starts on May 23rd, and until then, students should prepare for their projects: get on the project mailing lists, solidify your plans, figure out where all the version control repositories are and which branch or fork you'll be working on, and start doing preparatory work.

Here's to a great 2014 Summer of Code,

Eric & Raoul
