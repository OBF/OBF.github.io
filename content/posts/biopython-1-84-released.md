title: Biopython 1.84 released
url: /2024/06/28/biopython-1-84-released/

Biopython 1.84 has been released and is available from our [website](https://biopython.org/wiki/Download) and [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/biopython/1.84).

This contains about 5 months worth of updates, so the [change-log in the news file](https://github.com/biopython/biopython/blob/biopython-184/NEWS.rst) is longer than usual. There have also been a few [deprecations](https://github.com/biopython/biopython/blob/biopython-184/DEPRECATED.rst), most noteworthy this may be our last release with Python 3.9 support.

Many thanks to the Biopython developers and community for making this release possible, especially the following contributors:

- Anil Tuncel (first contribution)
- David Cain
- Fabio Zanini (first contribution)
- Joao Rodrigues
- Judith Bernett (first contribution)
- Luca Monari (first contribution)
- Meridia Jane Bryant (first contribution)

- Michael M. (first contribution)
