Yesterday we [hosted the OBF/BOSC contribution to the ISCBacademy webinar](/2022/01/20/iscbacademy-webinar-feb-22-yo-yehudi/). Our former OBF-board member and _Open Life Science_ co-lead [Yo Yehudi](https://twitter.com/yoyehudi/) presented how internship programs such as _Google Summer of Code_ or _Outreachy_ can be a great way to grow your open source community. If you missed the event, you can now [watch the recording on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4GVFMlUnMc).

Lalit Narayan, who is an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, was a first-time webinar attendee:

> "This was my first time attending a webinar from OBF and I enjoyed it. Yo was a really great speaker and it was fun to get guidance from them. I had done industrial internships in the past but not any formal research internships. I really liked the idea of getting connected to like-minded people and working together in a team to work on an interesting research idea. In a team environment we learn from peers and spend time together which eventually leads to a great network."
