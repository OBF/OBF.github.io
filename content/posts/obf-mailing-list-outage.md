This is a belated notice that the OBF mailing lists are down due to a server failure. Posting a tweet is easier than writing a blog post, please follow [@OBF\_news](https://twitter.com/OBF_news) for updates.

We have a complete back up and running as a virtual machine hosted on [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](http://aws.amazon.com), which should become live by Monday pending DNS updates etc.

Back in later 2012 we previously [migrated the OBF websites AWS](http://news.open-bio.org/news/2012/11/server-transition-to-aws/), and this has proved very reliable and saves us worrying about looking after physical hardware.

Update (Monday 16 June 2014): The replacement mailman server is now live, but our apologies for the inconvenience. Some delayed emails should now be delivered, but unfortunately older emails where you received a failure message will have to be resent.
