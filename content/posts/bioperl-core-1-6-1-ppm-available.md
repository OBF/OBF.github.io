BioPerl 1.6.1 is now available for ActivePerl as a PPM, instructions for downloading can be found on the [BioPerl wiki](http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Installing_Bioperl_on_Windows). This has been tested only for ActivePerl 5.10 and above, so any feedback with older versions of BioPerl would be greatly appreciated.
