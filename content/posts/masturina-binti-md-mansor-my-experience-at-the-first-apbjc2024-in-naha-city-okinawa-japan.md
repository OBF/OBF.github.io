_The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) Event Fellowship program](/travel-awards) aims to promote diverse participation at events promoting open-source bioinformatics software development and open science practices in the biological research community. Masturina Binti Md Mansor, a PhD student at the Universiti Putra Malaysia, was awarded an OBF Event Fellowship to attend [Asia & Pacific Bioinformatics Joint Congress 2024](https://www.apbjc.asia/)_.

I flew in to Okinawa, Japan, from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on 21st October 2024 for the first ever Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Joint Conference 2024 (APBJC). It was my first international conference as a PhD candidate, a memorable milestone that I will cherish as I push forth in my research journey. This APBJC was successfully brought together by the big houses of bioinformatics in the region, namely the Japanese Society for Bioinformatics (JSBi), the Asia-Pacific Bioinformatics Network (APBioNET), the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB), the Genome Informatics Workshop (GIW), and the Asia-Pacific Bioinformatics Conference (APBC). Digital advertisements flashed through the streets of Kokusai Dori in Naha in anticipation of the 4-day event (22nd October - 25th October) as the city welcomed around 700 participants from all around the world, bringing together researchers, scientists, academicians, industry players and other science/tech enthusiasts alike. The conference took place at the Naha Cultural Arts Theatre (NAHart), off the main street of Kokusai Dori.

With the generous funding from the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF), I was able to gain exposure to the different trends in bioinformatics, and network with other bioinformaticians in the field. Not only were researchers and academicians present, but industry players like Amazon, Megazone and Alafia also provided luncheon seminars on integrating their services in bioinformatics and healthcare. One thing I have noticed about being in the bioinformatics/computational biology field, is the exponential pace trends and new ideas are generated. This conference was a great opportunity for me to not only learn from other bioinformaticians, but also for me to gain feedback on my research as well.

The focus this year oriented around the integration of AI in bioinformatics and healthcare research. It was interesting to see how most oral and poster presenters integrated AI into their research. From protein structure prediction to omics data analytics, and to those who were complimenting computational work with experimental methods, AI was a big theme everywhere. It also gave me ideas on how to better leverage open source tools and other best practices for reproducible science, which I am eager to share with my colleagues back home in Malaysia. Being able to converse and exchange knowledge with other participants in APBJC on how AI would help us advance bioinformatics research was especially enlightening to me. It felt like the future was already here!

Whilst my journey to Okinawa was primarily to attend APBJC, I could not help but notice the charm and allure of the island. Even the airport was set at a picturesque background, with the turquoise waters of the sea visible from the airport terminal as I landed. It is a land rich in natural beauty, food, culture and welcoming people. The city was a unique mix of modern and old design, giving it that Okinawan identity.

Overall, the first APBJC was a huge success, of which I am grateful to have had the opportunity to be part of. It was truly a hallmark moment for the bioinformatics community in Asia and Pacific, coupled with Okinawa’s warm hospitality and welcome. I am hopeful this pivotal event will pave the way for more to come over the years as we endeavour together to advance and make science and technology accessible. Till we meet again next time!
