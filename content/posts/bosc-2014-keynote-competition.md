We're pleased to officially confirm that one of the two keynote speakers for the 15th annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference ( [BOSC 2014](/wiki/BOSC_2014)) will be C. Titus Brown, as he announced on Twitter recently:

In recognition of the growing use of Twitter and social media within science as a way of connecting across geographical divides, we're announcing a Twitter competition to guess who is scheduled to give the second keynote at BOSC 2014 in Boston.

To enter, please tweet using [hashtag #bosc2014](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bosc2014 "#BOSC2014 on Twitter") and include us via [@OBF\_BOSC](https://twitter.com/OBF_BOSC "@OBF_BOSC on Twitter"), e.g.

> I think @OBF\_BOSC should invite "Professor X" to be a keynote speaker at #BOSC2014 because ...

The first correct entry (within one week) will be awarded one complementary BOSC 2014 registration fee for themselves, or a nominated group member. This does not cover travel or accommodation, and there is no cash substitute if you cannot attend BOSC 2014. Members of the OBF board, BOSC organizing committee, and ISMB SIG committee are not eligible, nor are the keynote speakers themselves.

We intend to announce the mystery keynote speaker and any Twitter competition winner in one week's time, but reserve the right to cut short, modify, or cancel the competition.

Our ulterior motive is to crowd source ideas for future keynote speakers in BOSC 2015, so some serious suggestions please ;)

Further details about BOSC 2014 will be posted here:

Thank you,

Peter Cock & Nomi Harris, BOSC 2014 co-chairs.
