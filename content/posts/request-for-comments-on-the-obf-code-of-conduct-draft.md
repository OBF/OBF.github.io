title: Request for comments on the OBF Code of Conduct draft
url: /2021/05/12/request-for-comments-on-coc-draft/

---
The OBF is committed to providing a harassment-free and respectful environment for all members of our community. To ensure that we are clearly describing norms, rules, and recommended practices for all our participants and members, we have provided a first draft of the OBF Code of Conduct and shared it recently in our [newsletter](https://github.com/OBF/newsletter/blob/master/newsletters/2021-02.md).

You can find the draft together with our request for comments on this [pull request](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/pull/78) (see a [preview here](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/malvikasharan-CoC-draft/code-of-conduct/README.md)). If you have not already, please take a few minutes to add your comments in this pull request by **June 4th, 2021**.

The final draft of the Code of Conduct will be put up to a vote among all OBF members. With your feedback, we will ensure that it represents your voice and provides clear guidelines about how to report incidents and describes how reports will be handled.
