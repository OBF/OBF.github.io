Installation instructions for Bioperl have been added to the main Bioperl website. They have been updated with links and tags for the wiki. Currently, both pages are accessible through links from [Getting Bioperl](http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Getting_BioPerl) and [Installing Bioperl](http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Installing_BioPerl); these links will be subject to change. Please correct lins/tags/information as necessary.
