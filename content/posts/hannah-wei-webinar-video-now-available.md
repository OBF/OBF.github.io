On March 14, 2023, we held a webinar (hosted by [ISCBacademy](https://www.iscb.org/iscbacademy)) about "Re-Thinking the Patient’s Role in a Learning Health System: Lessons from the Patient-Led Research Collaborative" presented by Hannah Wei, co-founder and technologist at the Patient-Led Research Collaborative. See [the webinar announcement](/2023/03/07/iscbacademy-webinar-on-patient-led-research/) for a full description.

BOSC organizing committee member Monica Munoz-Torres introduced Ms. Wei and fielded a lively Q&A session. The webinar recording is available on YouTube at [https://youtu.be/M2vAotWKd\_Q](https://youtu.be/M2vAotWKd_Q).

The [ISCBacademy](https://www.iscb.org/iscbacademy) is a series of free webinars offered by the [ISCB](https://www.iscb.org/), which runs the annual ISMB conference, through the ISCB Communities of Special Interest (COSIs), which include BOSC/OBF. Each COSI gets two webinar slots per year, so watch for our next one in fall 2023!
