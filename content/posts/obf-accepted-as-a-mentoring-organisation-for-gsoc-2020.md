OBF has been selected as a Google Summer of Code [mentor organisation](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4996161846378496/) for the 5th consecutive time! We are proud to be hosting over [13 projects](http://open-bio.org/events/gsoc/project-ideas/) from various sub-organisations that aim to promote open science. This year OBF's application was led by Sarthak Sehgal, Kai Blin, Yo Yehudi, and Michael Crusoe. Last year, [GSoC 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/5294944380518400/), was another good year with five students successfully completing their projects.

## Call to students to apply for GSoC

OBF is welcoming students across the globe with a passion for open science to apply for GSoC. You can view the eligibility criteria [here](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq) and the whole timeline [here](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline). The application portal opens on March 16 but feel free to contact the mentors of projects you are interested in already. It’s a fantastic opportunity to write code, learn about open source development, and be a part of a welcoming and diverse community, while earning a stipend! All information about OBF's GSoC participation can be found [here.](http://open-bio.org/gsoc/)

### Looking forward to another successful Google Summer of Code!
