title: Sadly OBF not accepted for GSoC 2015

Last year's [Google Summer of Code 2014 was very productive for the OBF](http://news.open-bio.org/news/2015/02/obf-gsoc-2014-wrapup/) with six students working on Bio\* and related bioinformatics projects. We applied to be part of GSoC 2015, but unfortunately this year were not accepted.

Google's program is enormously popular, and over-subscribed, meaning Google has had to rotate organisation membership. The OBF is grateful to have been accepted in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014. This year any participation will be down to individual projects to find a willing umbrella group from the [organisations accepted for GSoC 2015](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/list/public/google/gsoc2015). For example, a [Biopython project was included under NESCent for GSoC 2013](http://informatics.nescent.org/wiki/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2013).

Other organizations with bioinformatics as keyword are [Ruby Science Foundation](https://github.com/SciRuby/sciruby/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2015-Ideas), [Department of Biomedical Informatics, Stony Brook University](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zJGT5AwnKqx8mJLmoeRnM_iZkEk-i6Ky_M4b3Z38w6o/edit), [OncoBlocks](http://bcb.dfci.harvard.edu/~cerami/gsoc.html), [University of Nebraska - Helikar Lab](http://helikarlab.org/GSoC.html). Other organizations related to sciences are [ASCEND](http://ascend4.org/Student_projects) , [BRL-CAD](http://brlcad.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/Project_Ideas), [Debian Project](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2015/Projects), [HPCC Systems®](https://wiki.hpccsystems.com/display/hpcc/HPCC+Systems+GSoC+2015+Ideas+List),  [International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility](https://www.incf.org/gsoc/2015/proposals) , [lmonade:](http://wiki.lmona.de/get_involved/gsoc) [scientific software distribution](http://wiki.lmona.de/get_involved/gsoc), [OSGeo - Open Source Geospatial F](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2015_Ideas) [oundation](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2015_Ideas), [The Concord Consortium](http://concord.org/GSoC), [The Visualization Toolkit](http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/GSoC_2015). Languages: [Python](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2015/python), [Scala](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2015/scalateam), [Apache Foundation](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2015/apache). Last but not least : [Global Alliance for Genomics & Health](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PHPDTzD4Z6xVoxN0Q1F8yEPclSri-JA1vLvMTrLYUi8/edit).

On behalf of the OBF, we would like to thank our volunteer GSoC Administrators, Raoul Bonnal and Francesco Strozzi, for organising our application - and all our potential mentors across the Bio\* projects who put forward potential project suggestions.
