The Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) Summer of Code program provides a unique opportunity for undergraduate, masters, and PhD students to obtain hands-on experience writing and extending open-source software for bioinformatics under the mentorship of experienced developers from around the world. The program is the participation of the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) as a mentoring organization in the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](http://code.google.com/soc/).

Students successfully completing the 3 month program receive a $5,000 USD stipend, and may work entirely from their home or home institution. Participation is open to students from any country in the world except countries subject to US trade restrictions. Each student will have at least one dedicated mentor to show them the ropes and help them complete their project.

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation is particularly seeking students interested in both bioinformatics (computational biology) and software development. Some [initial project ideas are listed on the website](/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code). These range from sequence search I/O in [Biopython](http://biopython.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code) to lightweight sequence objects and lazy parsing in [BioPerl](http://bioperl.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code), a next-generation [BioRuby](http://www.bioruby.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code) interface to Ensembl to developing cloud-optimized versions of [BioJava](http://biojava.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code) modules. All project ideas are flexible and many can be adjusted in scope to match the skills of the student. We also particularly welcome and encourage students proposing their own project ideas; historically some of the most successful Summer of Code projects are ones proposed by the students themselves.

**TO APPLY:** Apply online at the Google Summer of Code website (http://socghop.appspot.com/), where you will also find GSoC program rules and eligibility requirements. The 12-day application period for students runs from Monday, March 26 through Friday, April 6th, 2012.

**INQUIRIES:**

We strongly encourage all interested students to get in touch with us with their ideas as early on as possible. See the OBF GSoC page for contact details.
