Introductions of present BoD members and guests

#### OBF Board

- Term expirations confirmed.
- Board currently consists of Jason Stajich, Hilmar Lapp, and Chris Dagdigian.
- How to ensure Board meetings to meet bylaw requirements?
  - Teleconference over the phone
  - IRC not favored, might pose undue burden, also identification might be problematic
  - multi-jabber would be a possibility but also disfavored as creating a barrier (and technical issues)
  - Teleconference will be our future modus for binding vote-entitled Board meetings, meetings at BOSC will have BoF/membership discussion character
- Soliciting new leadership contribution
  - OBF is a volunteer effort.
  - Ability of people to commit time may depend on their institution's or employer's commitment to support this.
  - Frequent observation of volunteer projects is that there is a small group of people doing everything, getting burned out, and then moving on, requiring a new leadership to be recruited.
  - One can only encourage people to join if there is critical mass, professional conduct.
  - Consider projects and organizations that weren't presenting (Cytoscape and Ensembl as examples).
- Size of Board: bylaws doesn't make a stipulation.
- Election procedure
  - Explained procedure laid out by the bylaws.
  - Nominating committee should network and advertise broadly to obtain a pool of Director candidates.
  - Aaron Mackey volunteers to serve on the Nominating Committee.
  - Set ourselves a deadline of Sep 15 to have the nomination process complete and hold the BoD meeting the elects them.
  - Will approach members and consituents for suggestions of whom to approach.
  - Should aim for electing at least two new Directors, possibly 3.
  - Kam is on slate to be nominated for Director, and is committed to serve.
  - Should invite Darin London whether we would be interested in serving.
  - Should invite Toshiaki Katayama, or someone else he suggests from OBJ, to serve.
  - Would we want to be exclusionary to anyone? Only to people or organizations who would want to commercialize the organization, in whatever aspect.
- Secretary officer will temporarily held by Parliamentarian.

#### Financial report

- No update from Chris Dagdigian.
- Haven't lost any money, still have about $30,000 in two accounts.
- Kam will get ISMB account straightened out.

#### BOSC

- Bad catering for the meeting (only coffee, less-than-great lunch)
- No computer support for presentation.
- Need to resign ourselves to the fact that ISCB is factually no longer accountable to the SIGs since they absorb the losses and keep the profits.
- Concern that ISCB will factor the accounting such so that our historical surplus drops to zero, and may cut BOSC then.
- Is there an alternative venue for people to present instead of at BOSC?
  - Possibly OSCON, but who would attend / be able to attend OSCON?
  - ISMB covers many of the areas that motivates our constituency to come.
  - Should we hold the meeting at the same place at ISMB but organize it separately?
  - Conclusion: Hold BOSC 2009 in conjunction with ISMB.
    - But don't want to end up with the same situation as in Brisbane.
    - Supporting organizing committee attendance; OBF needs to be prepared to absorb the travel of the BOSC organizing committee chair (if the person's attempts to secure funding from elsewhere fail).
- Structure of BOSC:
  - Balance between demonstrations and presentations should be improved.
  - Could be very useful to fold OBF project tutorials (or others) into BOSC.
  - Software could be subject of talks on the first and of tutorials on the second day. Should presenters come prepared to give tutorials?
  - Content seems to work though for user-developers in terms of getting the information that they were looking for?
- Marketing the conference can be improved upon a lot.
  - Professional review with for the first time got feedback to the submitters.
  - Open source requirements were pretty rigorously enforced.
  - Emphasis on quality should help with marketing in the future.
- BOSC 2007 attendance was 97 (registered)
  - Have 77 primary sign-ups this year.

#### BOSC proceedings:

- Page charges from BMC are very high (BP850 normally, BP500 in bulk (BP10,000 for 20 papers) but then we have to do all the work ourselves).
- Authors may not have the incentive to use this venue because they may want to publish a full paper in a higher-impact venue.
- Should BOSC have Proceedings?
  - People should have the possibility to present at BOSC.
  - We are not at the level of quality as ISMB is.
  - The main thing that comes out of BOSC is code, presentations don't really add the main value.
  - We're not ready for having
- Looks like this is a non-issue?

#### OBF fund drive

- Using training to gain funds?
- Having more people on the Board should give us more possibilities to explore opportunities to raise funds.
- Sponsorship
  - BioTeam donates bandwidth, colocation space, domain purchases. Should acknowledge that appropriately on the OBF website.
  - Have sponsorship for BOSC from Helicos ($1000) and an anonymous donor ($250). The latter will fund the student travel fellowship and the former will subsidize the keynote speaker.
    - Possibly remaining funds will be used towards travel fellowships in 2009.
  - May in the future need to secure sponsorship to fund organizer travel.

#### Membership

- Trade restrictions:
  - Can we re-incorporate in Canada?
  - Should we seek legal advice? Yes, pro-bono if possible.
- Should chang the form to include date, having that is useful.
