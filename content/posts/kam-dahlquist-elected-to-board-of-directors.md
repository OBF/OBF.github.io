The [minutes of the November 2008 O\|B\|F Board of Directors meeting](/wiki/Minutes:2008_ConfCall#Minutes "2008 BoD meeting minutes") have been posted. The most important result of that meeting is that [Kam Dahlquist](http://myweb.lmu.edu/kdahlqui/)Â was elected to the Board, bringing the number of [Board members](/wiki/Board) back to four. Please join us in extending a warm welcome to Kam!

We aim to elect additional Directors this year, please contact the [Nominating Committee](/wiki/Board#Nominating_Committee) if you are interested in serving, or if you know people who might be. Suggestions of people we should tap to serve are also welcome and appreciated.

Among the other topics discussed the more important ones were the preparations for BOSC 2009, the hosting offer from the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC), and possibilities for obtaining 501(c)3 tax exempt status. See the minutes for details.
