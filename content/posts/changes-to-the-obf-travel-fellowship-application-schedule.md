title: Changes to the OBF Travel Fellowship application schedule

The [OBF Travel Fellowship program](/travel-awards/), which was started in 2016, will be making some changes to the schedule. Until now, there have been three application rounds per year, with deadlines April 15, August 15 and December 15.

For the next round, we are moving our December deadline two weeks earlier, to December 1, 2019.

Starting in 2020, we will move to two application deadlines per year, on March 1 and September 1. Applicants will be considered for events that take place in the year starting one month after the deadline--for example, for the December 1, 2019 deadline, we will consider applications for events scheduled to take place between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020.

We have made these changes to better accommodate long-term planning and to consolidate the demands on time for our Travel Fellowship reviewers.
