Wordpress 2.0.1 installed. Presumably no major differences to be seen but some bug fixes installed.

A Wiki spam filter was installed, we'll see how well it performs but trying to cut down on spammers.

We also will try and setup a RSS feed on the wiki main page so that news feeds from this site (and perhaps other open-bio sites) will be scrolled on the main BioPerl website. There are nice plugins for this in wikimedia we just need to find the time to do the install and testing.
