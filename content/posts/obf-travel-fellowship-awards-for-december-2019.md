Two awardees were chosen during the latest round of the [OBF Travel Fellowship program](/travel-awards/), which closed on December 1, 2019. The program, which started in 2018, provides some travel funding to selected applicants who, by attending events in open source / open science, will help to promote diversity in the community.

One of our awardees is [Laura Acion](https://lacion.rbind.io/) from the [Instituto de Calculo](http://www.ic.fcen.uba.ar/en/) in Argentina, who will be attending [CarpentryCon 2020](https://2020.carpentrycon.org/) (June 29 - July 1 in Madison, WI) and [Use R! 2020](https://user2020.r-project.org/) (July 7-10 in St. Louis, MO). Because the two conferences will be held fairly near each other in time and geographical location, Laura is optimizing travel by attending both of these meetings.

Our other awardee, Michael Thompson of the [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology](https://www.knust.edu.gh/) in Ghana, will attend [Galaxy Admin Training](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2020-03-admin/) to be held in Barcelona from 2 - 6 March 2020. This training will enable Michael to deploy Galaxy for production use at his university.

As always, we encourage community members who are planning to attend events that promote open source software development and/or open science in biology to apply for an [OBF Travel Fellowship](/travel-awards/). We particularly welcome applications from people who are members of historically underrepresented groups and/or who work in low-income research environments. In 2020, there will be two application calls that will close on 1 March and 1 September 2020.
