Thomas Down reports:

We've had a number of requests recently for a more recent snapshot of the biojava-live code, so I've just put together a biojava-1.3pre1 release. Get source, binaries, and javadocs from: [http://www.biojava.org/download/](http://www.biojava.org/download/)

This isn't absolutely set in stone yet, but should give a reasonable indication of what the forthcoming 1.3 series is going to look like. All testing and comments welcome!

One thing to note about the \*binary\* release: I've compiled this using Sun JDK 1.4.1. There may be compatibility problems with Java 1.3 runtime envionments in some cases, so if you're using Java 1.3 and think you've found a bug, please try downloading the source and recompiling. I've released jdk1.4 binaries this
time as an experiment. If there are violent objections, we can always do back to jdk1.3.1 for compiling binary releases, or perhaps provide both. Please let me know if you have any thoughts on this, or if it causes you trouble.
