At the OBF’s July 2019 [public Board meeting](/2019/08/16/obf-public-board-meeting-july-2019/) (held at BOSC 2019), Malvika Sharan was unanimously elected as a new at-large Board member. Malvika, who earned a PhD in bioinformatics at the University of Würzburg, is a community outreach coordinator at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg. She is passionate about promoting the inclusion of historically underrepresented groups in bioinformatics and STEM in general. Malvika recently won a fellowship from the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/fellowship-programme) to support her research into identifying and developing effective training strategies in low-income research environments (limited resources, lack of funding, etc.). She was also a recipient of an [OBF Travel Fellowship](/travel-awards/) that helped defray her cost of attending BOSC.

As a new OBF Board member, Malvika looks forward to helping the organization undertake more efforts to grow and support a vibrant, diverse open science community.
