Triggered by what happened during the hackathon in Singapore, the
Bioperl Ontology object model needs to undergo a number of changes that
I'm going to describe below, along with a proposal how to resolve the
issues. I have largely implemented the proposal and barring major
objections I'm ready to commit tonight or tomorrow morning. Even though
some of these things significantly change the API, we (I, backed by the
core people) propose to migrate these changes over to the 'stable' 1.2
branch, to be able to release bioperl-db (bridges to the biosql schema)
in dependency on a stable bioperl branch.
