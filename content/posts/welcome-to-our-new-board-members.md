As mentioned in [our previous blog post](https://news.open-bio.org/2018/03/05/march_2018_board_meeting/), last Friday the OBF had a board of directors meeting. [One of the notable meeting items this time](/wiki/Minutes:2018_Mar_ConfCall) was to elect more board members to help be involved with the community. We’re pleased to announce that both candidates, [Bastian Greshake Tzovaras](https://twitter.com/gedankenstuecke) and [Yo Yehudi](https://twitter.com/yoyehudi), were unanimously voted in by the other board members!Logically, one of their first moves as newly minted members was to draft this blog post! Some of the their possible ideas for the future include:

- Applying to participate as a mentor organisation in [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) \- a program similar to [Google Summer of Code](https://news.open-bio.org/), but specifically dedicated to increasing diversity in open source.
- Growing our network and connecting more closely with like-minded organizations in the open science-space

If any of these sound of interest and you’d like to be involved, please let us know by leaving a comment on this post, mailing the main [OBF mailing group](http://mailman.open-bio.org/mailman/listinfo/members) (membership required), or tweeting [@obf\_news](https://twitter.com/obf_news). We’re especially keen to hear if any of you have other suggestions for things you’d like to see to help build the community!
