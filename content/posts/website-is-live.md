(reposting this news from [O\|B\|F News](http://news.open-bio.org/archives/2006_01.html#000086))

I am pleased to announce the release of a new website for BioPerl. The site is based on the mediawiki software that was developed for the wikipedia project. We intend the site to be a place for community input on documentation and design for the BioPerl project. There is also a fair amount of documentation started surrounding bioinformatics tools and techniques applicable to using BioPerl and some of the authors who created these resources.

The website continues to be at the URL [http://www.bioperl.org](http://www.bioperl.org). The DNS updates may take up to 24 hours to reach everyone.

The initial content of the site is result of the work of myself, Mauricio Herrera Cuadra, Brian Osborne, and Torsten Seemann. We encourage you to contribute to the site's content by signing up for an account.

There are several guides for style of the site. One in particular is how to link to Modules which can contain additional information from the POD [http://bioperl.org/wiki/Module:Bio::SeqIO](http://bioperl.org/wiki/Module:Bio::SeqIO).

You'll notice that many of the paths have changed but the DIST and SRC continues to be available at http://bioperl.org/DIST and [http://bioperl.org/SRC](http://bioperl.org/SRC). The HOWTOs are now available from [http://bioperl.org/wiki/HOWTOs](http://bioperl.org/wiki/HOWTOs) (although we should be forwarding the old URL links to the correct place).

The FAQ is available at [http://bioperl.org/wiki/FAQ](http://bioperl.org/wiki/FAQ) and I encourage you to add your questions to it so they can be properly archived and addressed.

We also have initiated a News site for Bioperl for posting announcements regarding development and software. I would like to see if there are volunteers to post weekly or monthly summaries of mailing list traffic and development. [(this server)](http://www.bioperl.org/news/).
