BOSC is returning to ISMB in 2021, after a successful partnership with Galaxy for the first Bioinformatics Community Conference last year ( [BCC2020 online](https://bcc2020.github.io/)). Originally slated to take place in Lyon, France, [ISMB/ECCB 2021](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2021) announced today that the conference will be virtual. This news may be disappointing to some, but for others it offers an opportunity to participate in a conference that they would not have been able to travel to attend.

[Registration for the ISMB/ECCB 2021 virtual conference](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2021-registration) is for the full conference only -- there will not be an option to register for only some of the days, as there has been in the past. Registration fees are based on your status as a working professional, postdoc, or student, as well as what country you work in (or your home country for students).

### Requesting registration fee assistance

We realize that the cost of ISMB/ECCB may be prohibitive for some. If you are [submitting an abstract to BOSC](/events/bosc-2021/submit/) and would have difficulty covering the cost of registration, you can request registration fee assistance. To make it easy, this request can be made right on the abstract submission form. (Only the conference chairs will see these fee assistance requests -- the abstract reviewers will not.) We regret that we will not be able to offer registration fee assistance for those who are not submitting abstracts. (But you should consider submitting an abstract! Even if your work is preliminary, it may qualify for a poster.)

We hope to see you online at BOSC 2021!
