The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation travel fellowship program](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/master/Travel_fellowships.md)Â was launched in 2016 to help increase diverse participation at events promoting open source bioinformatics software development and open science in the biological research community. There are four application deadlines per year; the next will be **December 15, 2017**. If you are hoping to attend an open source / open science bioinformatics even and travel costs are a barrier, we encourage you to apply for one of our $1000 travel fellowships. More information, including a link to the application form, can be found at [https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/master/Travel\_fellowships.md](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/master/Travel_fellowships.md).
