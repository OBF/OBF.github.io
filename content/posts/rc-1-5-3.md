Sendu has [announced](http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/bioperl-l/2006-November/023916.html) that [Release Candidate 3](http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Release_1.5.2) is available for download and testing. This may be the last RC before the 1.5.2 release so give it a whirl and speak up with any problems or concerns.
