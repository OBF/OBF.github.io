The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is sponsored by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O\|B\|F), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development within the biological research community. To be considered for acceptance, software systems representing the central topic in a presentation submitted to BOSC must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be freely available for download in source code form.

Many open source bioinformatics packages are widely used by the research community across many application areas and form a cornerstone in enabling research in the genomic and post-genomic era. Open source bioinformatics software has facilitated rapid innovation, dissemination, and wide adoption of new computational methods, reusable software components, and standards. One of the hallmarks of BOSC is the coming together of the open source developer community in one location to meet face-to-face. This creates synergy where participants can work together to create use cases, prototype working code, or run bootcamps for developers from other projects as short, informal, and hands-on tutorials in new software packages and emerging technologies. In short, BOSC is not just a conference for presentations of completed work, but is a dynamic meeting where collaborative work gets done and attendees can learn about new or on-going developments that they can directly apply to their own work.

This year’s conference will mark the 10th anniversary of BOSC. To celebrate the special occasion, the theme of this year’s conference is “Looking Back and Looking Ahead: Open Source Solutions to Grand Challenges in Bioinformatics.” We are inviting abstracts for two different types of talks:

1\. Descriptions of a particular open source software implementation by a member of the development team, especially in the areas listed below.

2\. Reviews of open source software that compares and contrasts different solutions to the same bioinformatics problem.

In addition, we are asking all speakers to come prepared to lead an informal tutorial on their software during a Birds of a Feather/hackathon session. This year’s topics include:
Topics
Design Patterns in Bioinformatics
Regulatory Genomics
Multicore and GPGPU computing
Data & Analysis Management (shared session with DAM SIG)
Computational Grids
Visualization
There will also be updates from O\|B\|F-sponsored projects, and as always, abstracts may be submitted for open source software that does not fit neatly into the above categories. Lightning Talks will also highlight very recent developments.
