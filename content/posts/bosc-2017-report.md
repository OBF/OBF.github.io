BOSC 2017 ( [/wiki/BOSC\_2017](/wiki/BOSC_2017)) was held in Prague in July 2017 as part of the annual ISMB conference. Nearly 250 people, half of whom were first-time attendees, participated in the meeting. Over 50 talks and a similar number of posters covered topics ranging from workflow tools to a crowd-funded "tree of beers." This year's Open Data theme was reflected in the keynote talks by Madeleine Ball and Nick Loman and the panel discussion about the opportunities and challenges of open data.

A report about BOSC 2017 is now available on F1000 ( [https://f1000research.com/articles/6-1858/v1](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-1858/v1)), and most of the talk and poster abstracts and talk videos are linked from the schedule page ( [/wiki/BOSC\_2017\_Schedule](/wiki/BOSC_2017_Schedule)).

In 2018, BOSC will be partnering with the Galaxy Community Conference (GCC) as an experiment in broadening the BOSC community. We invite anyone who has an interest in open source bioinformatics or open science to join us in Portland, Oregon, June 25-30--see [https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) for more information.
