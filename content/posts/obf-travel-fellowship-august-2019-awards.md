A record number of people applied for the latest round of the [OBF Travel Fellowship](/travel-awards/), which closed on August 15, 2019. Out of this great set of applicants, we offered travel awards to three who epitomize the goal of the awards: to promote diversity in the world of open source bioinformatics / open science.

The awardees are **Arunav Konwar,** **Fernanda Troyner and Nicolás Palopoli**.

**Arunav** has contributed to open source projects including [Deep Learning Indaba](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/Baobab) (an African Machine Learning community), Wikimedia, and [Metafluidics.](https://metafluidics.org) He will give a talk and lead a workshop at the [Global Community Bio Summit 3.0,](https://www.biosummit.org/) which aims to democratize biotechnology by building an inclusive global network of people in the life sciences.

**Fernanda**, who participated in " [No Budget Science Hack Week](https://www.reprodutibilidade.bio.br/nobudgetsciencehackweek)", is fairly new to open science; she attended the Hack Week to learn about software tools for open science and launch her own open science project. She participates in the [Brazilian Reproducibility Initiative](https://www.reprodutibilidade.bio.br/home).

**Nicolás** will be co-leading the first [Carpentries Instructor training](https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/) in Lima, Peru, in October. He later declined the fellowship as the local organizers offered to cover his travel expenses.

Big congratulation to our awardees! We look forward to hearing more about their open source/science projects in future.
