Thanks to those who participated in the [BOSC 2014 Keynote Competition](http://news.open-bio.org/news/2013/12/bosc-2014-keynote-competition/)! Our winner is Manuel Corpas, who correctly surmised [Philip Bourne](https://twitter.com/pebourne):

(In fact, we had already confirmed Philip Bourne as our second keynote speaker _before_ his new job at NIH was announced.) Congratulations, Manuel, on winning free admission to [BOSC 2014](/wiki/BOSC_2014)!

Dr. Bourne's keynote talk will be entitled "Biomedical Research as an Open Digital Enterprise":

> The biomedical research lifecycle is fast becoming completely digital and increasingly open to the point that publishing could simply become changing the access control on given research objects comprising ideas, hypotheses, data, software, results, conclusions, reviews, grants and so on. This offers immense opportunities for software developers to enable the enterprise. I will describe a vision for the digital enterprise and what the NIH and others are doing to support the notion with the intent to accelerate scientific discovery.

Our other keynote speaker at BOSC 2014, as already announced, will be [Titus Brown](https://twitter.com/ctitusbrown), whose topic is "A History of Bioinformatics (in the Year 2039)".
