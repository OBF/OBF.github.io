**Overview of the last round of OBF Event Fellowship 2023**

The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) Event Fellowship program](/event-awards/) is now in its 8th year. Starting in 2023, we have three application rounds per year with the following deadlines: 1 April, 1 August, and 1 December.

In 2023 round 3 (December 2023), we received numerous applications, of which one applicant was awarded a fellowship for the event they were participating in. Congratulations to Thea Fennell. This fellowship will support their participation in the 17th Annual International Biocuration Conference to present their work on “Developing an open-source atlas charting functional module distribution across cell types in a range of mammalian species”.

We recently published blog posts from two of our latest awardees summarising their experiences attending events with help from OBF Event Fellowships:

- Raquel Garcia: [My Journey at the nf-core Hackathon and Nextflow Summit 2023: Coding and Community](/2023/12/17/journey-at-nf-core-hackathon-and-nextflow-summit-2023/)
- Yvonne Walburga: [Journeys across oceans](/2023/12/13/yvonne-walburga-journeys-across-oceans/)

Congratulations to all of our awardees!  We are delighted to support their participation with OBF Event Fellowships, and we wish them all the best for their future work.

**Please share this post and apply for the fellowship before 1 April 2024.**
