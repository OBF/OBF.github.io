We are pleased to announce the release of Biopython 1.43.

This release includes a brand-new set of parsers in [Bio.SeqIO](http://biopython.org/wiki/SeqIO) by Peter Cock for reading biological sequence files in various formats, an updated Blast XML parser in Bio.Blast.NCBIXML, a new UniGene flat-file parser by Sean Davis, and numerous improvements and bug fixes in Bio.PDB, Bio.SwissProt, Bio.Nexus, BioSQL, and others. Believe it or not, even the documentation was updated.

Source distributions and Windows installers are available from the Biopython website at http://biopython.org. My thanks to all code contributers who made this new release possible.
