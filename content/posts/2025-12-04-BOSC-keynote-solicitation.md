[BOSC 2026](/events/bosc) is planned for July 14-15, 2026, as part of ISMB 2026 in Washington, DC.

We invite our community to [nominate potential keynote speakers](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSchUjaUlZw9n05kinPrYOohqukURIJrK6y662E2jjqUlT1dRQ/viewform) who would be of interest to our community.
You may submit as many nominations as you wish. The [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSchUjaUlZw9n05kinPrYOohqukURIJrK6y662E2jjqUlT1dRQ/viewform) may be filled out multiple times. Please submit nominations by **December 15, 2025**.

### Why this matters
Keynote talks are always a highlight at BOSC.
We traditionally open and close the conference with invited speakers—prominent contributors or emerging leaders whose work resonates with the bioinformatics open-source community.

### About the selection process
Prior to 2023, keynote selection was handled internally by the BOSC Organizing Committee.
In 2023, we introduced a more consistent, transparent, and community-aligned process, including a public rubric for evaluating candidates.
The results were excellent, and we are continuing this open nomination process for 2026.
