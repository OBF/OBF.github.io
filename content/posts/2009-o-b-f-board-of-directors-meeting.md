The official 2009 Board of Directors meeting is taking place today, Monday Dec 14, at 4pm EST (21:00 UTC) via teleconference. If you are an O\|B\|F member, you will have received the announcement and dial-in information earlier.

O\|B\|F Board of Director meetings are public - anyone interested in O\|B\|F business can participate, which is one reason we are holding the meeting over teleconference. The dial-in number is +1-518-825-1400, participant code 279610.

All you need to participate is a telephone (this is a US toll number, and if you are located international or outside of the area code, pertinent charges from your phone carrier will apply). Or use SkypeOut, which costs a few cents per minute from many locations (check SkypeOut rates).

The [agenda for the meeting](/wiki/Minutes:2009_ConfCall) is on the OBF wiki (and minutes will be posted there later).
