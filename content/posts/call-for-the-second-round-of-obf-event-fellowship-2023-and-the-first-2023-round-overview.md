**Overview of the round 1 of OBF Event Fellowship 2023**

The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) Event Fellowship program](/event-awards/) is now in its 7th year. We open three application calls yearly with the following deadlines: 1 April, 1 August, and 1 December.

In 2023 round 1 (April 2023), we received 23 applications, of which three applicants were awarded this fellowship for various events they were participating in. Congratulations to **Yvonne Ateh Joko Walburga Epse Fru**, **Shirley Salcan** and **Daniela Senra**.

**Nehemiah Ongeso Mosioma,** who had been previously awarded a fellowship for attending the Vienna BioCenter PhD Program Symposium "Pushing Boundaries", but due to visa delays, could not attend the event. The OBF Fellowship Award chairs redirected this award towards attending the Society of Molecular Biology and Evolution (SMBE) 2023.

We recently published blog post from two of our latest awardees summarising their experiences attending conferences with help from OBF Event Fellowships:

- Winfred Gatua: [Winfred Gatua: Hybrid Carpentries workshop supported by OBF Event Fellowship](/2023/03/29/winfred-gatua-hybrid-carpentries-workshop/)
- Ruth Nanjala: [Ruth Nanjala: My experience attending and participating at the ICHG 2023 conference hosted in the Mother City](/2023/03/21/ruth-nanjala-experience-at-the-ichg-2023-conference/)

Congratulations to all of our awardees!  We are delighted to support their participation with OBF Event Fellowships, and we wish them all the best for their future work.

**Please share this post and apply for the fellowship before 1 August 2023**.
