_The_ [_Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) Event Fellowship program_](/travel-awards) _aims to promote diverse participation at events promoting open-source bioinformatics software development and open science practices in the biological research community. Felipe de Jesús Castañeda Córdova,_ an MD/MS student from LIIGH-UNAM (Laboratorio Internacional para la Investigacion sobre el Genoma Humano) Mexico _was awarded an OBF Event Fellowship to attend_ _the_ [EMBL-EBI Cancer Genomics and Transcriptomics 2024](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/cancer-genomics-and-transcriptomics/).

My name is Felipe de Jesús Castañeda Córdova. I am an MD/MS student from Mexico, primarily focusing on the wet lab aspect of lab work at the Cancer Genetics and Bioinformatics Lab. I had limited experience with bioinformatics (I performed some transcriptomic analyses for my master’s project, and I got the bug!), so I decided to apply to the online EMBL-EBI Cancer Genomics and Transcriptomics 2024 course. I was fortunate to be accepted into the program and receive an OBF Event Fellowship, which helped me cover the registration fee.

The EMBL-EBI Cancer Genomics and Transcriptomics 2024 course was a week-long intensive course aimed at an international audience. It focused on the theoretical and practical aspects of the most popular bioinformatics analysis tools for cancer research. Despite the time difference between Europe and home, I really enjoyed the entire course. Most of the theoretical classes were inspiring, and the practical portions helped ground our knowledge and resolve most of the questions and doubts that came up as we worked on our scripts. I liked the RNA-seq part of the course, probably because of my previous experience with the subject. Student experience and participation enhanced this section by helping to address many of the questions that typically arise when interpreting GSEA results. During the practical sessions, we had the chance to engage with other students and learn more about their projects and research.

I have already started using the skills and insights gained from this course to impact my research. I am reanalyzing my transcriptomic data, considering the new parameters we discussed during the course, and I am excited to apply the new programs and techniques we were introduced to.

The knowledge I gained from this experience goes beyond technical skills. It has broadened my perspective and deepened my understanding of the bioinformatics community as a whole. It has made me more aware that regardless of our geographical location, we all encounter similar challenges and obstacles. It has also emphasized the importance of collaboration and continuous learning, which are essential for progress in this rapidly evolving field.

I am deeply grateful to the Open Bioinformatics Foundation for providing me with this fellowship and the opportunity to attend the EMBL-EBI Cancer Genomics and Transcriptomics 2024 course. The experience has been immensely rewarding, both professionally and personally. I encourage anyone interested in bioinformatics to consider participating in such events and to take advantage of the opportunities offered by organizations like the OBF.
