The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is sponsored by the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O\|B\|F)](/), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development within the biological research community. To be considered for acceptance, software systems representing the central topic in a presentation submitted to BOSC must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be freely available for download in source code form.

We invite you to submit abstracts for _talks and posters_. Sessions include:

- Approaches to parallel processing
- Cloud-based approaches to improving software and data accessibility
- The Semantic Web in open source bioinformatics
- Data visualization
- Tools for next-generation sequencing
- Other Open Source software

In addition to the above sessions, there will be a panel discussion about _"Meeting the challenges of inter-institutional collaboration"_. We are also working to arrange a joint session with one of the other ISMB SIGs.

Thanks to generous sponsorship from Eagle Genomics and an anonymous donor, we are pleased to announce a competition for three _Student Travel Awards_ for BOSC 2011. Each winner will be awarded $250 to defray the costs of travel to BOSC 2011.
