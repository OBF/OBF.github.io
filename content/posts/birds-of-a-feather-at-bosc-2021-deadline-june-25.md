Birds of a Feather (BoFs) are informal, self-organized meetups focused on specific topics. They are a great way to meet other like-minded community members and have an in-depth discussion on a topic of shared interest.

[BoFs at ISMB/ECCB 2021](https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2021/bof/) will take place each day of the meeting except the last day, at the same time as the poster session (not ideal, we know--but there are only so many viable hours in the day), from 15:20-16:20 UTC. We recommend that you choose either Thursday, July 29 (the first day of BOSC) or Wednesday, July 28 (the day before BOSC).

Any ISMB/ECCB participant is welcome to propose a BoF! All you need is a topic, a leader, and a brief description. **Submit your BoF proposal at [https://www.iscb.org/cms\_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2021/bof/](https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2021/bof/) no later than June 25.**

If you're organizing a BOSC-related BoF, [let us know](mailto:obf-bosc@googlegroups.com)! We'll list it on our website ( [/events/bosc-2021/bosc-2021-schedule/](/events/bosc-2021/bosc-2021-schedule/)) and tweet about it!
