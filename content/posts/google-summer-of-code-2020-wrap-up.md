This year, OBF received 5000 USD from Google for being a mentoring organisation. The funds from GSoC go into the general OBF Fund that is primarily used to sponsor [OBF Event Fellowships](/event-awards/) which is a program aimed at increasing diverse participation at events promoting open science practices such as resource development and dissemination in the bioinformatics and biological research community.

Thank you to all our volunteer GSoC administrators and mentors - and of course thank you to the students - we hope you'll continue to work in bioinformatics and/or open source.
