Diversity, inclusion and accessibility (also known as Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, DEI) are a major part of BOSC’s mission and core values, and we pursue these goals in multiple ways. BOSC 2022, for example, included a [panel on Building and Sustaining Inclusive Open Science Communities](/events/bosc-2022/bosc-2022-panel/), with panelists who not only were experts on the topic but also themselves belong to various groups that are typically underrepresented in our community. And with generous support from our [sponsors](/events/sponsors), each year we provide free registration to 10-20 BOSC participants as part of the [OBF Event Fellowship program](/event-awards/)), which aims to increase diverse participation at events related to open source bioinformatics and open science.

Jenea Adams, a Presidential Ph.D. Fellow in Genomics and Computational Biology at the University of Pennsylvania, epitomizes our commitment to fostering diversity and inclusion in the open source bioinformatics community. Jenea served as one of the panelists on the Building and Sustaining Inclusive Open Science Communities panel, and her registration fee and travel expenses were covered by an OBF Event award.

Jenea commented, "BOSC not only showcased the remarkable strides made in computational biology but also emphasized the power of collaboration and inclusivity. Through my participation in the panel on Building and Sustaining Inclusive Open Science Communities, I witnessed the true potential of harnessing diverse perspectives to drive innovation and create a sustainable foundation for open science."

In addition to her PhD studies, Jenea is the Founder and Executive Director of [The Black Women in Computational Biology Network](https://www.blackwomencompbio.org/), which aims to amplify the voices and foster community among Black women in computational biology.  Jenea observed, "Having support to attend BOSC 2022 made it possible for me to connect with new and familiar faces in person while providing a platform to share the work and progress of The Black Women in Computational Biology Network."

Jenea summed up her thoughts about BOSC -- thoughts we strongly agree with -- as follows: "This conference reinforced the notion that by being intentional about accessible science and sharing knowledge, resources, and ideas openly, we can collectively advance the field of computational biology and pave the way for transformative discoveries."

We thank Jenea for contributing her knowledge and community-building spirit to BOSC, and wish her the best in all her endeavors!
