Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) main website
=================================================

This git repository hosts static HTML for the OBF website, which
GitHub pages serves at http://obf.github.io/ and which we will
later point https://open-bio.org to. This is designed to replace
the WordPress site used until 2025.

This repository will host:

* The front-page ``index.html``
* The board of directors ``/board/``
* Member projects ``/projects/``
* Event Award (originally called the OBF Travel Fellowship), ``/event-awards/``
* Membership ``/membership/``
* Code of contact ``/code-of-conduct/``
* Dontations ``/donate/``
* Other small misc. content originally in WordPress

Separate repositories handle other parts of the website, most of which
will be static:

* https://github.com/OBF/wiki hosts the historical ``/wiki/`` content,
  originally hosted in MediaWiki but converted to Markdown.
* https://github.com/OBF/bosc2000 to https://github.com/OBF/bosc2016
  host the ``/bosc2000/`` to ``/bosc2016`` content, static HTML in the
  earlier meetings, later on just the PDFs like abstracts.
* https://github.com/OBF/wp-content hosts the historical ``/wp-content/``
  files uploaded via WordPress (mostly photos for blog posts etc).

Pending:

* The ``/bosc/`` content originally in WordPress
